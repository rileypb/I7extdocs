 Chapter 1 - Acknowledgements and notes
<p>
 The extension relies on the &quot;Object Kinds&quot; extension by Brady Garvin. A useful and versatile extension, Object Kinds can unfortunately not be found in the Public Library. Instead, you need to download it from its GitHub page, via the address

<p>
 Thanks to Alice Grove and Matt Wighdahl, who provided sanity check, invaluable feedback and much-needed encouragement.

 Chapter 2 - The reason for this extension
<p>
 While Inform 7 is a very good system for creating IF, it's still a compiled language. A natural consequence of that is its lengthy iteration cycle: coding is followed by compilation (often aborted by the discovery of a bug), then testing by reaching a game state, only to discover something is lacking, at which point we go back and do it all over again. This, mind you, is in the ideal bug-free case. Every step of this sequence carries the attendant risk of getting side-tracked, losing steam, or tiring an author by constantly switching between tasks. Rapid Prototyping is an attempt to shorten the loop by giving feedback in a manner reminiscent of REPL type languages like Python.
<p>
 The extension only provides basic building functionality. Nontrivial behavior such as rules and activities are well beyond its scope.
<p>
 Using Rapid Prototyping follows a basic workflow. First, you keep the dynamically generated source code under its separate header. Next, you compile a minimal game. While walking through the game, you add and modify the world as needed, until you hit a point where the extension's facilities are inadequate (see above for examples). At that point, you &quot;view source&quot;, copy the generated code, and paste it under the prepared header. After having added any complex functionality under its own header, you recompile, and the cycle starts again.
<p>
 Chapter 3 - How to use this extension
<p>
 Instead of creating the game and then testing it, Rapid Prototyping aims for a more natural process of designing an IF world: you compile an empty game, then add rooms, things and various other bits and pieces as you see fit. These changes to the game world appear at run-time, and can be interacted with seamlessly. Once you are satisfied with how the world behaves, the &quot;view source&quot; command produces source code that you can then use for refining the next iteration. Finally, by adding the flag &quot;finally&quot; to &quot;view source&quot;, you can output source code without the metainformation used internally by the extension.
<p>
 Note that all examples here use testing correction, which is only needed when using the TEST command to demonstrate functionality.
