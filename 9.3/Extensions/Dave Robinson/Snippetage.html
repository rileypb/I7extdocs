<p>
 Snippetage has several rules to allow us to make and manipulate snippets more easily. Snippets in Inform 7 are fragments of the player's command that start at a certain word and go on for a certain number of words. This extension gives rules for working out what numbers are the start, end and length for snippets; it tells us if a snippet is valid or invalid, and it defines a couple of other handy things like the &quot;verb word&quot; snippet. Any valid snippet can be used in a say rule, or matched against a topic. So you can put:<blockquote><font color="#000080"> say &quot;You used the verb [verb word].&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 or<blockquote><font color="#000080"> if the word at the end of the player's command matches &quot;bananas&quot;....</font></blockquote>
<p>
 or<blockquote><font color="#000080"> if the snippet at the verb position of length 2 matches &quot;look in&quot;...</font></blockquote>
<p>
 A snippet is decided to be valid if its start is in the player's command and ends later in the player's command. So<blockquote><font color="#000080"> if the snippet at word 1 of length 0 is invalid, say &quot;That snippet is invalid.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 would indeed say it was invalid (because it has zero length), and<blockquote><font color="#000080"> if the snippet at the end of the player's command of length 2 is invalid, say &quot;That snippet is invalid.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 would also say the snippet is invalid, because it extends beyond the end of the player's command.
<p>
 Example: * Pedantic Bob - Some simple printing and matching of snippets, and an input-quoting error message
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> &quot;Pedantic Bob&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Include Snippetage by Dave Robinson.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The Pit is a room. &quot;The pit looks the same as ever, and quite inescapable. Apart, possibly, from [the red door] to the south.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> A door called a red door is south of the pit and north of Freedom. The description is &quot;You have heard that the red door leads to freedom, but you don't know if you believe it.&quot;.<br> The red door is lockable and locked.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> After going south from the pit, end the game in victory.<br> Before entering the red door, try going south instead.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Rule for writing a paragraph about the red door: now the red door is mentioned; rule succeeds.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The brass key unlocks the red door.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Bob is a man in the Pit. &quot;Bob stands nearby.&quot;. The description is &quot;Bob responds to commands. He doesn't usually obey them, but he often responds to them.&quot;.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Asking Bob about something is attempting conversation.<br> Telling Bob about something is attempting conversation.<br> Answering Bob that something is attempting conversation.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Before attempting conversation:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say &quot;Bob is not much interested in conversation, but he might respond to commands.&quot; instead.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Instead of asking Bob to try doing something:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if the verb word matches &quot;x&quot; begin;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say &quot;'X!' Bob cackles. 'X marks the spot!'&quot;;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; otherwise;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; let n be the verb position;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if n is the end of the player's command, say &quot;'I can [verb word] as much as you want,' Bob says. 'It won't help.'&quot;;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; otherwise say &quot;'You want me to [verb word]?' Bob says. 'Are you sure you mean [command from verb position onwards]?'&quot;;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; end if.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Instead of asking Bob to try examining the parrot when the verb word matches &quot;describe&quot;:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say &quot;'Looks like a cockatoo to me,' Bob observes.&quot;;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now the parrot is renamed.<br> Instead of asking Bob to try examining the parrot, say &quot;Bob looks over at [the parrot] and grunts boredly.&quot;.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> A parrot is an animal in the Pit. The parrot is neuter.<br> &quot;[A parrot] sits nearby giving the occasional squawk.&quot;<br> The parrot can be renamed. The description is &quot;[if renamed]A fine example of a cockatoo[otherwise]It looks like a parrot, but you're not sure[end if][if the parrot is holding the brass key]. It's holding a brass key[end if].&quot;.<br> The parrot is holding a brass key.<br> Before taking the brass key, if the parrot is holding the key, say &quot;[The parrot] flutters away as you reach for the key.&quot; instead.<br> Before taking the parrot, say &quot;[The parrot] dodges away from you.&quot; instead.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> After reading a command: if the player's command is valid and a random chance of 1 in 3 succeeds begin;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; let n be the end of the player's command;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say &quot;'Awwwk [word at n] [word at n] [word at n]!' [the parrot] shrieks.&quot;;<br> end if.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Understand &quot;bird&quot; as the parrot.<br> Understand &quot;cockatoo&quot; as the parrot when the parrot is renamed. The printed name of the parrot is &quot;[if renamed]cockatoo[otherwise]parrot[end if]&quot;.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Before asking a parrot to try doing something:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if the word at 1 matches &quot;parrot&quot;, say &quot;'Parrot?' [the parrot] squawks. 'Who's a parrot?'&quot; instead;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if the word at 1 matches &quot;it&quot;, say &quot;'It?' [the parrot] squawks. 'Oh, I'm [italic type]it[roman type] now, am I?'&quot; instead;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if the word at 1 matches &quot;bird&quot;, say &quot;'Bird?' [the parrot] repeats incredulously. 'Is that the best you can do?'&quot; instead.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Before asking the parrot to try giving the brass key to someone, try asking the parrot to try dropping the brass key instead.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Persuasion rule for asking the parrot to try doing something other than dropping:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say &quot;[The parrot] just squawks.&quot;;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; persuasion fails.<br> Persuasion rule for asking the parrot to try dropping: if the parrot is holding the noun, persuasion succeeds; otherwise persuasion fails.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> After the parrot trying dropping the key, say &quot;[The parrot] drops the key to the ground.&quot;.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 In addition to annoying word-repeating characters, we can have a word-repeating parser, which repeats back words it didn't understand, something like this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Rule for printing a parser error when parser error is not a verb I recognise:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say &quot;The verb '[verb word]' is not needed in this game.&quot;.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Test me with &quot;Examine parrot / It, drop key / Parrot, drop key / Bird, drop key / Bob, wait / Bob, x me / Bob, examine me / Bob, examine parrot / Bob, describe the parrot / Cockatoo, drop key / Scrape the cockatoo / Take the key / Unlock the door / Open it / South&quot;.</font></blockquote>
