<p>
 First I would like to thank Sebastian Rahn for helping me test this update and providing helpful feedback.
<p>
 Section: Basics of this Extension
<p>
 This extension adds the actions shooting something with something and stabbing something with something.
<p>
 Shooting a non-person thing is allowed, but has no real affect on the thing without additional rules. It is possible to make a game where the player has to shoot bottles to win a prize, or even to stop an enemy in a vehicle by shooting the tires.
<p>
 Stabbing a non-person thing is also allowed, but again does nothing on it's own. Again, the uses for this would depend on what the author had need to do with it.
<p>
 Another thing this extension does is add a few kinds: weapon (kind of thing), projectile (kind of weapon), blade (kind of weapon), fire arm (kind of projectile), bow (kind of projectile), knife (kind of blade) and sword (kind of blade). An author can create most any weapon they want using fire arm, bow, knife or sword, and they should behave properly.
<p>
 Lastly, this extension makes it possible for a player holding a weapon to succeed in persuasion up to 80% of the time.
<p>
 Section: Changes in this Version
<p>
 The shooting and stabbing actions now work for any actor, not just the player.
<p>
 This version no longer causes instant death when shooting or stabbing a person. Everyone starts out with 100 health, and attacks do various damage depending upon the weapon used and random outcomes.
<p>
 The player can use examine me for information about his or her health.
<p>
 Taking inventory will also allow the player to see his or her present health.
<p>
 Examining a NPC will also allow the player to see the present health of the NPC.
<p>
 If the player shoots or stabs another actor, that actor will become hostile. Hostile actors will take any weapon available (if there is one) and fight back.
<p>
 Additionally, a dead person no longer magically vanishes. A dead person, naturally, can not do anything, and little can be done to a dead person. If the need should arise, however, it is now possible to search the corpse of a fallen enemy, and take anything they may have been carrying.
<p>
 Section: 6L02 Compatibility Update
<p>
 This extension differs from the author's original version: it has been modified for compatibility with version 6L02 of Inform. The latest version of this extension can be found at &lt;https://github.com/i7/extensions&gt;.
<p>
 This extension is released under the Creative Commons Attribution licence. Bug reports, feature requests or questions should be made at &lt;https://github.com/i7/extensions/issues&gt;.
<p>
 Example: * Bob Fights Back! - A simple game featuring poor Bob. We can order Bob around (if we carry a weapon), or eliminate Bob. In this example, Bob will grab a weapon (if there is one available) and fight back. Using test commands may not give the desired results, as there is a 20% chance Bob will not do as he is told. After running the test me, one can restart the game to try something different. Trying test Bob will show Bob refusing to be bullied (and with luck, Bob refusing to commit suicide).

 Example: ** Shooting Gallery - Bob invites you to shoot bottles to win a prize! This example is to show why it might be useful to allow a non-person thing to be shot. It shows the report shooting non-people rule being replaced, as well as a simple way to make shooting a non-person thing actually do something.

<p>
 Example: *** Trolls - Bob, king of the trolls, must be destroyed! This example shows how easy it is to override some of the values used by Armed, such as max health and maximum damage, as well as how to make a NPC always want to attack the player on sight. Additionally, this example shows a simple way to create something to restore health to the player.
