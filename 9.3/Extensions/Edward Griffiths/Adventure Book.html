 Chapter: How to Write an Adventure Book
<p>
 Section: Introduction
<p>
 Adventure Book for Inform 7 is a recreation of the behavior of Jon Ingold's Adventure Book programming system. It offers a reasonably simple syntax for people who would like to create Choose Your Own Adventure style programs without a lot of hassle, but it also allows for some advanced features to make your program feel more like a real game -- changing conditions, inventory items, and magic words.
<p>
 This documentation assumes some familiarity with Inform 7, but it's written with beginners and non-programmers in mind.
<p>
 Special thanks to Jon Ingold for his feedback in the development of this extension. Comments are welcome at cpface@execpc.com.
<p>
 Section: Version History
<p>
 Version 1/140513
<p>
 This extension differs from the author's original version: it has been modified for compatibility with version 6L02 of Inform. The latest version of this extension can be found at &lt;https://github.com/i7/extensions&gt;.
<p>
 This extension is released under the Creative Commons Attribution licence. Bug reports, feature requests or questions should be made at &lt;https://github.com/i7/extensions/issues&gt;.
<p>
 Version 1/091203
<p>
 Original release.
<p>
 Version 1/110101
<p>
 Giving and Removing relations renamed to Adding and Clearing, respectively, to avoid a conflict with newer versions of Inform 7. Code structure described in earlier documentation (&quot;It gives [flagname].&quot; and &quot;It removes [flagname].&quot;) should be unaffected, but any user-written code that refers directly to the relations will need to be modified.
<p>
 &quot;Use memory economy.&quot; has been added to the extension to give authors a slightly larger buffer to work with.
<p>
 Section: Setting Up a Page
<p>
 A good start to any programming language is creating a program to write &quot;Hello World!&quot;. So let's start with that and see how a page is set up.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><img border=0 src=../../../doc_images/paste.png> &quot;The Hello World Story&quot; by Edward Griffiths</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Include Adventure Book by Edward Griffiths</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The First Page is a page.<br> &quot;Hello World!&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 This is sufficient to create a running program. If you click Inform 7's Go! button, you'll be presented with the Adventure Book opening screen and prompted to continue. When you do, you'll be shown the text &quot;Hello World!&quot; and given a prompt. Of course, since we haven't created any options for the player to try, the program can't continue in any useful way.
<p>
 Notice how the page is written. The first line, &quot;The First Page is a page.&quot;, tells Inform that we're creating a new page and we're calling it The First Page. On the next line, we write what it says on that page, surrounded by quotes. And that's really all there is to it.
<p>
 Pages can have just about any name you can think of. If it makes sense to you to call them &quot;Page 1&quot;, &quot;Page 2&quot;, and so on, that's fine. You can also name them after what happens on that page, such as &quot;Exploring the Cave&quot; or &quot;Arguing with Robert&quot;. The only really important rule is that the first page of your story must be called The First Page.
<p>
 Notes for beginners: Whenever quoted text is used to describe a page or a choice, either the text must end with a sentence-ending punctuation mark (.!?) or there must be a period after the second quotation mark. All other sentences must end with a period. Within quoted text, replace all quotation marks with ' marks; the game will automatically replace them with the appropriate marks when the game is run. For example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> &quot;Margaret storms up to you.  'Do you really need the radio that loud?' she huffs.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 will be printed as:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Margaret storms up to you. &quot;Do you really need the radio that loud?&quot; she huffs.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Section: Choices
<p>
 The most important function of an Adventure Book is to offer the player choices. Choices are listed after the quoted text that describes a page. Here is a page with three choices:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The First Page is a page.<br> &quot;You are at the beach.  What would you like to do?&quot;<br> A choice called TheFirstPageA is for The First Page. &quot;Go for a walk.&quot; It triggers Go Walking.<br> A choice called TheFirstPageB is for The First Page. &quot;Build a sand castle.&quot; It triggers Building a Sandcastle.<br> A choice called TheFirstPageC is for The First Page. &quot;Go for a swim.&quot; It triggers Go Swimming.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Creating a choice has at least three parts. First, &quot;A choice called [something] is for [a page].&quot; tells Inform that we are creating a new choice for the page we've named. What we decide to call the choice isn't important because we'll never have to refer to it, but we can't have two choices with the same name. It's a good idea, then, to give a choice a name that refers in some way to the page that it's on to avoid making duplicates.
<p>
 The second part is quoted text that's displayed when the page is read. You don't need to include the number that the player types to select the option; the system does that automatically. When the program is run, the page above will be printed like this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> You are at the beach. What would you like to do?</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> 1) Go for a walk.<br> 2) Build a sand castle.<br> 3) Go for a swim.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 The third part tells where the story will go if the player selects this choice. &quot;It triggers Go Walking.&quot; means that, if the player selects &quot;Go for a walk.&quot;, the program will &quot;turn to&quot; the page with the name Go Walking, and play will continue from there.
<p>
 Section: Pages Without Choices
<p>
 Sometimes we'll want to direct the story to a particular place without requiring (or allowing) the player to make a decision. If this is the case, we'll follow the description of a page with the sentence &quot;It is followed by [the name of a page].&quot; instead of a list of choices. For example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The First Page is a page.<br> &quot;The directions have taken you through miles of back roads to an angry-looking house with chipped blue paint and foggy windows.  Is this really Melissa's house?&quot;<br> It is followed by The Driveway.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The Driveway is a page.<br> &quot;You are standing in the driveway of what may or may not be Melissa's house.  What is your next move?&quot;<br> A choice called...</font></blockquote>
<p>
 After the game prints the text for The First Page to the player, it will automatically continue on to The Driveway without any input from the player and continue reading from there. The chain can be as long as you'd like, with any number of &quot;It is followed by...&quot; statements.
<p>
 One practical use for dividing up the action like this is that it allows us to return to the page called The Driveway and take further action there without reprinting the description of the player's initial arrival; if the player has been exploring the grounds for a while, the directions that brought him there aren't likely to be on his mind anymore. In more traditional Adventure Books, it may simply be a convenient way to join convergent plot lines together -- forcing paths through the plot to meet at a particular place.
<p>
 Another useful behavior is for a page to return to the page that called it after it is read to allow the player to make a different choice. This is done by replacing the list of choices with the sentence &quot;It is a dead end.&quot; For example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><img border=0 src=../../../doc_images/paste.png> &quot;Stranger at a Party&quot; by Edward Griffiths</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Include Adventure Book by Edward Griffiths</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The First Page is a page.<br> &quot;You find yourself lost in a throng of revelling strangers.&quot;<br> A choice called TheFirstPageA is for The First Page. &quot;Talk to the gentleman by the drinks.&quot; It triggers NoReply.<br> A choice called TheFirstPageB is for The First Page. &quot;Talk to the guy by the stereo.&quot; It triggers NoReply.<br> A choice called TheFirstPageC is for The First Page. &quot;Talk to the man sitting on the couch.&quot; It triggers NoReply.<br> A choice called TheFirstPageD is for The First Page. &quot;Talk to one of the guys sharing stories in the corner.&quot; It triggers Your Friend Jake.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> NoReply is a page.<br> &quot;He casts you a withering stare.&quot;<br> It is a dead end.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Your Friend Jake is a page.<br> &quot;When you approach the guys in the corner, you're surprised to find your good friend Jake.  Did he say he was coming to this party?&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 When the player selects an option that triggers the page NoReply, he'll be given a discouraging message and prompted to pick a different option from The First Page.
<p>
 There are a number of uses for this sort of behavior. In a traditional Choose Your Own Adventure book, it was sometimes necessary to tell the player that there was something wrong with a choice he made and to force him to go back and try it again; this would allow us to send the player back without needing to know which page he came from. This is also useful for creating choices for smaller actions that don't drastically change the plot; &quot;Take a closer look at the old oak tree&quot;, for example, may trigger a page that describes the tree in detail, but, since it doesn't open up any new choices for the player, it sends him back to try something else.
<p>
 It's worth mentioning that the author is allowed to string together a long chain of pages with &quot;It is followed by...&quot; statements and then to declare the last one to be a dead end. In this case, the program will flip back to the last page it read that offered the player a choice.
<p>
 Finally, sooner or later, every story reaches its conclusion. To end a story, simply replace the list of choices with the sentence &quot;It is followed by The Last Page.&quot; The Last Page is a special page defined by the Adventure Book extension which does nothing except to offer the player choices to restart the game, restore a saved game, or quit. For example, here is a page that ends a story:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Drinking the Poison is a page.<br> &quot;You bring the bubbling brew to your lips and take a long drink.  It burns your throat and suffocates you.  You feel faint...<br><br>*** You have died ***&quot;<br> It is followed by The Last Page.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 When Drinking the Poison is read, the following text is displayed:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> You bring the bubbling brew to your lips and take a long drink. It burns your throat and suffocates you. You feel faint...</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> *** You have died ***</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> X) Restart<br> R) Restore<br> Q) Quit</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> &gt;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Using The Last Page to end a story is recommended, but optional. There is no reason why you can't create your own game-ending pages.
<p>
 This is all you need to know to create a functioning Adventure Book game. The next chapter will demonstrate some advanced features.
<p>
 Chapter: Advanced Features
<p>
 Section: Setting Conditions
<p>
 The advantage of a computer program over a traditional Choose Your Own Adventure story is that the computer can remember what has already happened and adapt what happens next based on that history. Adventure Book lets you use on or off markers called flags to keep track of what has happened and what the player can do.
<p>
 Flags don't need to be declared in any special way. If you create a page that turns a flag on or off, Inform will automatically create that flag for you. However, a flag can be created with a sentence like &quot;[The flag's name] is a flag.&quot; For example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> TheReadingLampIsOn is a flag.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Most flags begin the game in the off position. To set a flag to the &quot;on&quot; position, add the line &quot;It gives [the flag's name].&quot; just after the page's description and before the list of choices:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Turning on the Reading Lamp is a page.<br> &quot;You turn the reading lamp on.&quot;<br> It gives TheReadingLampIsOn.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Now, whenever Turning on the Reading Lamp is read, the flag called TheReadingLampIsOn will be turned on.
<p>
 To return a flag to the off position, add the line &quot;It removes [the flag's name].&quot; just after the page's description:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Turning off the Reading Lamp is a page:<br> &quot;You turn the reading lamp off.&quot;<br> It removes TheReadingLampIsOn.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Any number of &quot;It gives ...&quot; and &quot;It removes...&quot; lines can be added to a page, just as long as they're all listed before defining the choices (or &quot;It is a dead end.&quot; or &quot;It is followed by...&quot; statements) for that page. For example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Confusing Mess is a page:<br> &quot;Goodness!  A lot has happened on this page!&quot;<br> It gives TheDuckHasBeenSeen. It removes TheShirtIsWhite. It gives LoudMusicIsPlaying. It is a dead end.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Flags affect the game by changing which options are allowed on a given page. Here is a choice to look at a bookshelf, but only if the reading lamp is turned on.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> In the Library is a page.<br> &quot;You are in your cozy library, surrounded by your favorite books.&quot;<br> A choice called IntheLibraryA is for In the Library. &quot;Look at the bookshelf.&quot; It triggers Examine Bookshelf. It requires TheReadingLampIsOn.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Adding &quot;It requires [flag name].&quot; to the description of a choice prevents it from being printed if the flag is turned off. In this case, the player will never be able to select an option to look at the bookshelf unless the flag TheReadingLampIsOn has been turned on.
<p>
 Adding &quot;It is cancelled by [flag name].&quot; to the description of a choice prevents it from being printed if the flag is turned on. This can be used to create choices like this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> In the Library is a page.<br> &quot;You are in your cozy library, surrounded by your favorite books.&quot;<br> A choice called IntheLibraryA is for In the Library. &quot;Look at the bookshelf.&quot; It triggers Examine Bookshelf. It requires TheReadingLampIsOn.<br> A choice called IntheLibraryB is for In the Library. &quot;Look at the bookshelf.&quot; It triggers Too Dark. It is cancelled by TheReadingLampIsOn.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 This would give the player a choice called &quot;Look at the bookshelf.&quot; no matter whether the lamp is on or not, but where the player goes when he selects it depends on the state of the lamp.
<p>
 Any number of &quot;It requires...&quot; or &quot;It is cancelled by...&quot; statements can be added to the end of a choice's description. If any one of them would prevent a choice from being displayed, the choice is not printed.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> A choice called ByThePondA is for By The Pond. &quot;Look at the ducks.&quot; It triggers Examine Ducks. It requires TheDucksAreByThePond. It is cancelled by TheStreetLightIsBroken.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 In this case, &quot;Look at the ducks.&quot; would only be printed if TheDucksAreByThePond is on and TheStreetLightIsBroken is off.
<p>
 Note for advanced Inform users: You can alter the text printed in a page using the techniques described in Chapter 5.5 of Writing with Inform. The syntax for the conditions is simply &quot;[if (the name of the flag) is (on or off)]&quot;.
<p>
 Section: Inventory Items
<p>
 One thing we might like to do in a game is give the player an inventory of items that he can use in different situations. Inventory items offer a bit more flexibility than flags alone, but they need to be declared first.
<p>
 For example, suppose I want to make a game, and the items I want to add are a sword, a shield, and a flask. This is how I'd declare them:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The sword is an inventory item. The shield is an inventory item. The flask is an inventory item.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 &quot;[Name] is an inventory item.&quot; tells Inform that you're creating a new inventory item and gives it a name. It's a good idea to have one-word item names to keep things from getting confusing. When you have a lot of items in a game, listing them out individually can be cumbersome. The line above can be shortened to:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The sword, the shield, and the flask are inventory items.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Inventory items can be declared anywhere in your code, but it's easier to keep track of them if you group them near the top.
<p>
 Once your item is declared, it can be used exactly the same way as a flag. Pages can give or remove an inventory item, and choices can require or be cancelled by items:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> A choice called InTheArenaA is for In the Arena. &quot;Attack the monster.&quot; It triggers Attack Monster. It requires the sword.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 But inventory items have a more subtle use. At any time, the player can type the name of an item he's holding to try and use that item instead of selecting one of the choices offered to him. Most of the time, this will simply tell the player &quot;You can't use that here.&quot;, but we can change that by adding a special kind of choice to our page called a use. The choice above could be written as a use like this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> A use called InTheArenaA is for In the Arena. It triggers Attack Monster. It uses the sword.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 There's no descriptive text because this option is never explicitly printed for the player; he will have to take the initiative to try and use his sword without prompting from the system. Notice &quot;It uses the sword.&quot; instead of &quot;It requires the sword.&quot; That means that the player will actually have to type in the sword's name in order to use this option.
<p>
 One problem with Choose Your Own Adventure style stories is how explicitly the player's options are spelled out for him. Having &quot;hidden&quot; choices available for the player makes the game seem a little less confined.
<p>
 Section: Magic Words
<p>
 Magic words are another way to allow the player to make a choice that hasn't been explicitly offered to him. For example, you could set up a computer terminal that requires a password or create a magic word that can be used to defeat an ogre or set up a puzzle that requires the player to deduce the correct sequence of keys to press. For a situation like this, we can create a special command called a magic word.
<p>
 To create a magic word, you simply declare it like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Xyzzy is a magic word.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Now we can make uses for xyzzy.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> A use called IntheHouseA is for In the House. It triggers Teleport to Caves. It uses xyzzy.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 A magic word never needs to be given or removed. (In fact, trying to give or remove a magic word will have no effect.)
<p>
 Suppose we want to make a number for the player to enter, like &quot;413&quot;. Inform won't allow us to use a purely numeric name for a magic word; &quot;413 is a magic word.&quot; will cause an error. In this case, it's probably better to use a sequence that has other characters in it, like &quot;4-1-3&quot; or &quot;4/13&quot;. But if it's absolutely necessary, then there is a work-around if you define your magic word like this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> 413 x is a magic word.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 The name &quot;413 x&quot; is a tricky way to declare a magic word that can be referred to as &quot;413&quot;. (Technically, &quot;x&quot; will also refer to it, but the system will override it in favor of the restart command.)
<p>
 Now we can make a use like this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> A use called IntheVault is for In the Vault. It triggers Open the Vault. It uses 413 x.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 A word of caution: when using purely numeric sequences for magic words, they will always override the choices that the player types in, even on pages that don't use that magic word. For example, if we decide that the number 1 is going to be a magic word, like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> 1 x is a magic word.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 then the player will never be allowed to select option number 1 on any page. (And, as a consequence, will never be able to leave the Introduction Screen.) In general, it's best to look for alternatives to purely numeric sequences.
<p>
 Section: Debugging
<p>
 As your story grows in size and complexity, it can get difficult to keep track of everything. The Adventure Book extension provides a number of debugging commands that are only available when you're testing your game in Inform 7. There are reports about the game state as well as cheats that allow you to skip to any page, modify any flag, and acquire any inventory item.
<p>
 On the most basic level, the game attempts to detect when a page has been left unwritten as you are playing it. How does the system decide if a page is unwritten? Well, whenever you refer to a new page -- when declaring a choice or a use or using &quot;It is followed by...&quot; to describe a page -- Inform 7 creates a blank page with that name. Unless a formal definition is provided for that page, the page will have no description, no choices, and no way to continue; if the game leads the player to that page, it will end abruptly and mysteriously. Since it's perfectly valid to create a page that doesn't have a text description (see the example &quot;Conversation Trees&quot; for a useful application), the system defines an unwritten page to be a page that has no way to continue -- no choices, no &quot;It is followed by...&quot; statement, no &quot;It is a dead end.&quot; statement.
<p>
 As you're playing the game, any choice that would lead to an unwritten page is preceded by three asterisks (***). Here is an example of an unfinished story to show you how it works:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><img border=0 src=../../../doc_images/paste.png> &quot;Unfinished&quot; by Edward Griffiths</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Include Adventure Book by Edward Griffiths</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The sword is an inventory item. Xyzzy is a magic word.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The First Page is a page.<br> &quot;An excellent start to your adventure!  What are you going to do first?&quot;<br> A choice called tfpa is for The First Page. &quot;Set off for adventure!&quot; It triggers The Next Page.<br> A choice called tfpb is for The First Page. &quot;Set BOLDLY off for adventure!&quot; It triggers The Third Page.<br> A use called tfpc is for The First Page. It uses the sword. It triggers The Swordplay Page.<br> A use called tfpd is for The First Page. It uses xyzzy. It triggers The Xyzzy Page.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The Third Page is a page.<br> &quot;You take an appropriately BOLD stance as you set off for adventure!&quot;<br> It is followed by The Next Page.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The Fourth Page is a page.<br> &quot;You find yourself high up in the mountains!  What next?&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Since we never defined The Next Page in this story, the choice &quot;Set off for adventure!&quot; is listed as:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> *** 1) Set off for adventure!</font></blockquote>
<p>
 This is a visual cue to the author, as he's testing, that that part of the game isn't working yet. It's a useful hint, but it has a limitation -- it doesn't check to the end of a chain of &quot;It is followed by...&quot; statements to make sure that it ultimately leads to a written page. And so the second choice isn't marked in any way, and if the player selects that choice, he is taken to The Third Page, which is followed by The Next Page, where the game comes to an abrupt halt. Moreover, there are no indications at all for the use commands, since they're never printed in the page descriptions.
<p>
 The &quot;report&quot; command is provided to help the author catch all of the missed connections in his story. At any time, you can type &quot;report&quot; instead of a normal game command to bring up a list of all unwritten pages and a summary of the paths that lead to that page as well as a list of pages that don't have any connection to them whatsoever. Print a report for the story above, and you'll see all sorts of problems with it:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Searching for pages that don't have any option to continue...</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The Next Page has no options to continue.<br> * The choice &quot;Set off for adventure!&quot; for The First Page triggers The Next Page.<br> * The Third Page is followed by The Next Page.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The Swordplay Page has no options to continue.<br> * A use for the sword for The First Page triggers The Swordplay Page.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The Xyzzy Page has no options to continue.<br> * A use for Xyzzy for The First Page triggers The Xyzzy Page.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Fourth Page has no options to continue.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Searching for pages that can't be reached:<br> Fourth Page</font></blockquote>
<p>
 It's a good idea to print a report for any game before you release it; short of exhaustively attempting every single choice of your game, it can be easy to miss one little connection along the way.
<p>
 Suppose, however, that you have intentionally written a page without any means to continue. For example, you're writing a page to replace The Last Page. In that case, it can be annoying or misleading to see choices that lead to those pages marked with asterisks or to see them show up in reports. If this is the case, you can indicate that a page is &quot;a special page&quot; when you declare it:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The Really Last Page is a special page.<br> &quot;GAME OVER.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Now The Really Last Page will never show up in any reports, and any choices that lead to this page will be unmarked. It's important that you only use this option if you really mean it. The whole point of the report command is to remind you of parts of the story that you still need to continue; declaring a page to be &quot;special&quot; to keep it from being included in reports as you work on other parts of the story defeats the purpose.
<p>
 As you're testing a large game, it can be a chore to have to exhaustively test every option, especially the parts of your game that depend on the states of flags and inventory items, and especially when you have to start from the beginning every time. To facilitate testing, a number of commands are provided to help you jump around to different parts of the story.
<p>
 First, there's the &quot;skip to&quot; command. Type &quot;skip to [the name of a page]&quot;, and the game will behave exactly as if you'd selected a choice that led to that page; flags and inventory items will be given or removed, the chain of &quot;It is followed by...&quot; commands will be followed, and, if the final page is a dead end, it will return to the page you were just reading.
<p>
 To make navigation between pages a little easier, you can type &quot;page names on&quot; to display the name of each page as it's read. (And, of course, typing &quot;page names off&quot; turns them off again.) As a last resort, you can type &quot;list pages&quot; to get the complete list of all pages in the story, but this can get very, very long.
<p>
 Finally, there are commands for manipulating the flags. At any time, you can type &quot;list flags&quot; to get a list of all flags in the game, and whether they're on or off. (Similarly, you can get lists of all inventory items or magic words by typing &quot;list items&quot; or &quot;list magic words&quot;, respectively.) You can set any flag or obtain any inventory item by typing &quot;give [name of flag or item]&quot;, and you can turn any flag off or dispose of any inventory item by typing &quot;remove [name of flag or item]&quot;. If you're in a hurry, &quot;give all&quot; will set all flags and give you all of the inventory items, and &quot;remove all&quot; will clear all flags and trash all items.

 Chapter: Integrating Inform 7 Code
<p>
 Section: Relationships
<p>
 The purpose of the Adventure Book extension is to provide beginners and non-programmers a relatively simple and flexible way to write interactive fiction. However, experienced Inform 7 users may want to take full advantage of the language to produce more advanced effects. This chapter will detail how the Adventure Book system works behind the scenes and give authors some basic guidelines for using Inform 7 code to change or extend Adventure Book's behavior.
<p>
 The Adventure Book system is built on three core kinds of things: pages, choices, and flags. A use is a kind of choice, an inventory item is a kind of flag, and a magic word is a kind of inventory item. The meat of an adventure book program is describing the properties of these objects and their relationships with each other.
<p>
 Here is a comprehensive list of all of the relationships defined by Adventure Book:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Offering relates one page (called the parent) to various choices. The verb to offer (it offers, they offer, it offered, it is offered, it is offering) implies the offering relation. The verb to be for implies the reversed offering relation.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Triggering relates various choices to one page (called the destination). The verb to trigger (it triggers, they trigger, it triggered, it is triggered, it is triggering) implies the triggering relation.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Following relates one page (called the destination) to various pages. The verb to follow (it follows, they follow, it followed, it is followed, it is following) implies the following relation.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Adding relates various pages to various flags. The verb to give (it gives, they give, it gave, it is given, it is giving) implies the adding relation.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Clearing relates various pages to various flags. The verb to remove (it removes, they remove, it removed, it is removed, it is removing) implies the clearing relation.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Requiring relates various choices to various flags. The verb to require (it requires, they require, it required, it is required, it is requiring) implies the requiring relation.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Cancelling relates various flags to various choices. The verb to cancel (it cancels, they cancel, it cancelled, it is cancelled, it is cancelling) implies the cancelling relation.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Using relates various uses to one inventory item (called the tool). The verb to use (it uses, they use, it used, it is used, it is using) implies the using relation.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 You could, if you wished, rewrite the syntax for the game system by defining new verbs for the relationships. For example, if you don't like the expression &quot;It triggers...&quot; and you'd prefer to write &quot;It turnsto...&quot; instead, simply include this line in your program:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The verb to turnto (it turnsto, they turnto, it turnedto, it is turnedto, it is turningto) implies the triggering relation.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Now you can write a (grammatically incorrect) sentence like:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> A choice called thefirstpagea is for The First Page. &quot;Go on a hike.&quot; It turnsto GoHiking.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Section: The Adventure Book Phrasebook
<p>
 The following is a list of all phrases defined by Adventure Book and what they do.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> turn to (destination - a page)</font></blockquote>
<p>
 The Adventure Book system uses variables called &quot;current page&quot; and &quot;previous page&quot; to mark the player's place. The phrase &quot;turn to [page name]&quot; is used when we must conclude an author-written command by turning to a new page. It is responsible for updating the current and previous pages, flipping through the book until it reaches a page with a choice, rebuilding the list of choices based on where we ended up and how the game flags look, and giving the player the result. This should NOT be used in a &quot;to run inform code for...&quot; block; use &quot;change pages to...&quot; instead. (See the section on Running Inform Code.)
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> set (x - a flag)</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Sets x to the on position. If x is an inventory item, it moves x into the player's possession.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> clear (x - a flag)</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Sets x to the off position. If x is an inventory item, it removes x from the player's possession.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> rebuild the list of choices</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Throws out the old list of choices and creates a new one based on the current state of flag variables and the current page. This should always be done in a command that alters the game's flags without turning to a new page; otherwise, the player may be allowed to select choices that are no longer valid. Also, it's a good idea to end such commands with &quot;try looking&quot; to show the player his new list of choices.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> read (x - a flag)</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Prints the description of the given page and does nothing else.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> read through to the next decision</font></blockquote>
<p>
 This phrase is primarily used by the &quot;turn to...&quot; phrase, and it's responsible for a lot of the messy work of moving from page to page correctly. First, it runs any special inform code that may be defined for the current page. Then, it sets and clears any flags associated with that page. If the current page is followed by another page, it prints the description of the page and moves to the next page, running inform code and manipulating flags until it reaches the end of the chain of &quot;It is followed by...&quot; statements. If the current page is a dead end, it skips back to the page where the player made his last decision WITHOUT running inform code or manipulating flags.
<p>
 It won't be necessary to invoke this phrase in most cases; it's usually much more useful to just use &quot;turn to...&quot; instead. However, it is available if necessary -- if, for example, you'd like to write a new &quot;turn to...&quot; phrase.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> decide if (possibility - a choice) is valid</font></blockquote>
<p>
 This is true if the choice is not cancelled by any &quot;on&quot; flags and it does not require any &quot;off&quot; flags, and false otherwise.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> decide if (possibility - a page) is unwritten</font></blockquote>
<p>
 This is false if the page has no means to continue (no choices, no &quot;It is a dead end.&quot; statement, no &quot;It is followed by...&quot; statement) and true otherwise.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> change pages to (x - a page)</font></blockquote>
<p>
 This phrase changes the current page to the given page and then runs inform code for it. (See the section on Running Inform Code.)
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> run inform code for (x - a page)</font></blockquote>
<p>
 This phrase does nothing unless it has been redefined by the author. (See the section on Running Inform Code.)
<p>
 Section: New Commands
<p>
 One way to modify the behavior of the Adventure Book system is to create a new game command. The extension normally overrides most of the player commands that are built into Inform 7, but it doesn't have to. A table called the Table of Commands holds all of the extra commands that Adventure Book recognizes beyond the numbers for selecting choices and the names of inventory items and magic words. You can add new commands to this list by continuing the table like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Table of Commands (continued)</font><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><font face="lucida grande,geneva,arial,tahoma,verdana,helvetica,helv" size=2><font color="#000080"> topic</font></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><font face="lucida grande,geneva,arial,tahoma,verdana,helvetica,helv" size=2><font color="#000080"> &quot;jump&quot;</font></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><font face="lucida grande,geneva,arial,tahoma,verdana,helvetica,helv" size=2><font color="#000080"> &quot;examine [an inventory item]&quot;</font></font></td></tr></table></blockquote>
<p>
 This will allow the player to use the commands &quot;jump&quot; and &quot;examine [something]&quot; in exactly the same way that they're used in Inform 7.
<p>
 For example, let's say that we want to allow the &quot;examine&quot; command so that the player can look at his inventory items without having to provide him an explicit choice to do so. We would add &quot;examine&quot; to our Table of Items, and provide descriptions for all of the things the player might carry:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><img border=0 src=../../../doc_images/paste.png> &quot;A Closer Look&quot; by Edward Griffiths</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Include Adventure Book by Edward Griffiths</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Table of Commands (continued)</font><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><font face="lucida grande,geneva,arial,tahoma,verdana,helvetica,helv" size=2><font color="#000080"> topic</font></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><font face="lucida grande,geneva,arial,tahoma,verdana,helvetica,helv" size=2><font color="#000080"> &quot;examine [an inventory item]&quot;</font></font></td></tr></table></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The ball is an inventory item. The description is &quot;Round and colorful.&quot;<br> The pail is an inventory item. The description is &quot;A small sand toy.&quot;<br> The ruby is an inventory item. The description is &quot;Red and beautiful.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The First Page is a page.<br> &quot;You've got a handful of knickknacks.  Type 'examine (item)' to take a closer look.&quot;<br> It gives the ball, the pail, and the ruby.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Note that only the word &quot;examine&quot; will be accepted; synonyms like &quot;look at&quot; will have to be rejected unless we specifically list them.
<p>
 Most Inform 7 commands aren't designed to function with Adventure Book's world model, so this is more useful for authors who want to add their own custom commands to a game. When a command is carried out, it can print information, adjust flags, and even move the player to a different page, if necessary. See The Adventure Book Phrasebook for the list of phrases that you can use in your commands to change the game state.
<p>
 Section: Running Inform Code
<p>
 Whenever a page is triggered (except when it's returned to as a result of a dead end statement), the system invokes a phrase called &quot;run inform code for [page name]&quot;. This is the default behavior:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> To run inform code for (x - a page):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do nothing;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 This doesn't do anything interesting on its own. Rather, it's an entry point that allows the author to sneak in a snippet of Inform code that's performed in special circumstances.
<p>
 For example, let's say that we want to have a choice that could lead to one of two pages, chosen at random. We could define a special case for &quot;run inform code for...&quot; that randomizes the player's destination when that choice is invoked:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><img border=0 src=../../../doc_images/paste.png> &quot;Opening Kickoff&quot; by Edward Griffiths</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Include Adventure Book by Edward Griffiths</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The First Page is a page.<br> &quot;You toss the coin up in the air...&quot;.<br> A choice called tfpa is for The First Page. &quot;Which way did it land?&quot; It triggers Landing.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Landing is a special page.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> To run inform code for (x - Landing):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if a random chance of 1 in 2 succeeds:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; change pages to Heads;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; otherwise:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; change pages to Tails;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Heads is a page.<br> &quot;Heads!&quot;<br> It is followed by Reflip.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Tails is a page.<br> &quot;Tails!&quot;<br> It is followed by Reflip.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Reflip is a page.<br> &quot;Care to try it again?&quot;<br> A choice called reflipa is for Reflip. &quot;Sure!&quot; It triggers Landing.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 The phrase &quot;change pages to [page name]&quot; is used in &quot;run inform code for...&quot; definitions when we want to trigger a different page as a result of what happened in our program. It ensures that any inform code for the new page will be run as the game continues forward. It is bad practice to use &quot;turn to...&quot; statements in your &quot;run inform code for...&quot; definitions because it can lead to recursion and unexpected effects.
<p>
 Inform code extensions can give an Adventure Book a whole new flavor. See the example &quot;Combat System&quot; for a demonstration.
<p>
 Chapter: Changes From the Original Adventure Book
<p>
 Section: Feature Changes
<p>
 Authors who are already familiar with Jon Ingold's Adventure Book should hardly notice any changes in the look and feel of programs created with Adventure Book for Inform 7. However, there are a few subtle differences.
<p>
 First, there are no longer &quot;win&quot; or &quot;lose&quot; commands. The program doesn't end unless the player explicitly quits. This is to allow the player a chance to restart or restore when a game is over without having to restart the entire program. The command &quot;It is followed by The Last Page.&quot; is provided to give authors a sort of standardized &quot;end game&quot; menu, but it doesn't differentiate between winning, losing, or other game-ending conditions. The author is welcome to create his own game-ending pages, and a few suggestions are offered in the Examples chapter.
<p>
 Second, there are fewer practical limits on how many choices each page can support. A practically unlimited number of choices and uses can be attached to each page. However, only 30 choices can be printed at once. This means that, if there are more than 30 choices on a page, you will have to make sure that some of them are blocked by &quot;It requires ...&quot; or &quot;It is cancelled by ...&quot; commands to keep them under the limit. (Ideally, any page which needs so many choices should probably be broken down into sub-pages just to make things less confusing for the player.)
<p>
 Third, you can now set conditions on an option to use an inventory item. You can use this to ensure that certain conditions are met before the player can use an item in his inventory; a key can't be used if the door is already unlocked, a gun can't be fired unless the player has loaded it with bullets, and so on.
<p>
 Section: Porting Original Adventure Book Programs
<p>
 It's relatively simple to import code from the original Adventure Book into Adventure Book for Inform 7. ADV files are human-readable, plain text files that can be opened with any text editor. This section details how to convert existing Adventure Book games into new projects that can be compiled in Inform 7.
<p>
 First, let's look at an example of how a page is described in an ADV file:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> * YourHouse<br> Your house is a rather modest little shack near the edge of town. It keeps<br> the wind and the rain out on sunny days.<br> +Venture forth+Road<br> +Consider the loaf of bread on the table+Considerbread~@-BREADGONE</font></blockquote>
<p>
 An ADV file declares the name of a page with a line that begins with an asterisk (*). The line &quot;* YourHouse&quot; translates to:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> YourHouse is a page.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Text that doesn't begin with a special symbol is the description of the page. This can stay more or less as it is, but it should be enclosed in quotation marks, and any internal quotation marks should be replaced with ' marks.
<p>
 A + sign indicates a choice. The text after the first + sign is the description of the choice. The text after the second + sign is the name of the page that it opens to. &quot;+Venture forth+Road&quot; translates to:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> A choice called yourhousea is for YourHouse. &quot;Venture Forth&quot;. It triggers Road.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 A tilde (~) indicates a condition. The text immediately after the tilde is the name of the flag or inventory item that the condition is checking for. If the name begins with an @ sign, it is an &quot;It is cancelled by ...&quot; condition. Otherwise, the condition would be an &quot;It requires ...&quot; condition. If there is a - sign before the name, it is checking for a flag. Otherwise, it is checking for an inventory item. So &quot;~@-BREADGONE&quot; is an &quot;It is cancelled by ...&quot; condition that is checking for a flag. The last line of the example translates into this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> A choice called yourhouseb is for YourHouse. &quot;Consider the loaf of bread on the table&quot;. It triggers Considerbread. It is cancelled by BREADGONE.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 There may be multiple conditions on the same line, all separated by tildes. A line like &quot;~-DUCKGONE~@-MUSICON~RADIO~@SANDWICH&quot; can be broken down into four sentences:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> It requires DUCKGONE. It is cancelled by MUSICON. It requires the radio. It is cancelled by the sandwich.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 where the radio and the sandwich are inventory items that are declared at the beginning of the text.
<p>
 Put it all together, and the example page looks like this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> YourHouse is a page.<br> &quot;Your house is a rather modest little shack near the edge of town.  It keeps
the wind and the rain out on sunny days.&quot;<br> A choice called yourhousea is for YourHouse. &quot;Venture Forth&quot;. It triggers Road.<br> A choice called yourhouseb is for YourHouse. &quot;Consider the loaf of bread on the table&quot;. It triggers Considerbread. It is cancelled by BREADGONE.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 A line that starts with a # indicates a special command for the ADV file reader. &quot;#div&quot; is a diversion to the page named immediately following &quot;#div&quot;. For example, &quot;#divForest5&quot; would translate to:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> It is followed by Forest5.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 &quot;#ret&quot; is a &quot;return&quot;, called a dead end in the Inform 7 version. &quot;#ret&quot; translates directly into:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> It is a dead end.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 &quot;#win&quot; and &quot;#die&quot; are commands for ending the game. The closest thing to this in Inform 7 is diverting to The Last Page:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> It is followed by The Last Page.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Lines that begin with &quot;&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;&quot; signs are &quot;It gives ...&quot; and &quot;It removes ...&quot; commands, respectively. So &quot;&gt;SWORD&quot; becomes:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> It gives the sword.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 where the sword is an inventory item, and &quot;&lt;-BRIDGEBARRED&quot; becomes:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> It removes BRIDGEBARRED.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 where BRIDGEBARRED is a flag.
<p>
 A line that begins with a colon (:) is a use. The text after the first colon is the item that's being used, and the text after the second colon is the page to turn to if that item is used. So a line like &quot;:LICENSE:TakeBridge&quot; becomes:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> A use called crossbridgea is for CrossBridge. It triggers TakeBridge. It uses the license.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Chapter: Examples
<p>
 Section: Special Effects
<p>
 Adventure Book boils interactive fiction down to its most basic elements -- accepting choices from the player, and changing the game state to match those choices. There are a lot of limitations to writing a game in this format, but with a little cleverness, it's fairly simple to create some very interesting effects. We'll conclude with some examples of some simple effects that may help fire up your imagination as well as a complete game written with the original Adventure Book and translated into Inform 7.
<p>
 Example: * Simple Choices - The basics of setting up a story with choices.
<p>
 This is a simple example of how to set up branching text - no flags or inventory items required. If you can understand how this works, then you're ready to start writing your own stories.
<p>
 Notice that there is a lot of repetition between pages in this story when the events of the previous pages don't have much influence on the current state of the story, but it does influence later events. If we used flags - say, a flag to tell whether or not the grandmother has been eaten - we could save a lot of typing by leading both outcomes of the grandmother scene to a single page, then checking later to see if the grandmother was eaten when it makes a difference to the narrative.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><img border=0 src=../../../doc_images/paste.png> &quot;Little Red Riding Hood Interactive&quot; by Edward Griffiths</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Include Adventure Book by Edward Griffiths</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The First Page is a page.<br> &quot;Once upon a time, there was a little girl who lived in a cottage on the edge of the woods.  Everywhere she went, she wore a bright red riding hood, and everyone who knew her called her Little Red Riding Hood.&quot;<br> It is followed by Page 2.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Page 2 is a page.<br> &quot;One day, Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother fell ill, and so her mother gave her a basket of goodies to take to her grandmother's house.<br><br>'But be careful on the road through the forest,' her mother said.  'Stay on the path, and don't talk to any strangers.'&quot;<br> It is followed by Page 3.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Page 3 is a page.<br> &quot;But as Little Red Riding Hood made her way to her grandmother's, she came upon a wicked wolf.  But he was so kind and so sweet that she quite forgot her mother's instructions.<br><br>'Where are you going, Little Red Riding Hood?' he asked.<br><br>'I'm going to visit my grandmother,' Little Red Riding Hood explained.  'She lives in the cottage on the other edge of the forest.  She's very sick, and I'm bringing this basket of goodies to cheer her up.'<br><br>The wolf heard this, and he licked his chops, scheming to himself.  'Perhaps you should stop a moment to pick some flowers for her,' the wolf suggested.  'That would be sure to cheer her up.'&quot;<br> It is followed by Page 4.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Page 4 is a page.<br> &quot;As Little Red Riding Hood stopped to pick a bouquet of flowers for her grandmother, the wolf ran on ahead.  What did he do when he reached the grandmother's cottage?&quot;<br> A choice called p4a is for Page 4. &quot;He tied her up and threw her in the closet.&quot; It triggers Page 5.<br> A choice called p4b is for Page 4. &quot;He ate her up in one bite.&quot; It triggers Page 6.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Page 5 is a page.<br> &quot;When the wolf reached the grandmother's cottage, he knocked on the door.  'Who is it?' asked the grandmother.  'It's your granddaughter, Little Red Riding Hood,' the wolf replied, disguising his voice.<br><br>But when the grandmother opened the door and found a ferocious wolf, she screamed and fainted dead away.  And so the wolf tied her up with her own bedsheets and locked her up tight in the closet.<br><br>With the grandmother safely locked up, the wolf dressed himself in her bedclothes, climbed into her bed, and pulled the sheets up over his head.&quot;<br> It is followed by Page 7.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Page 6 is a page.<br> &quot;The wolf broke open the door to the grandmother's cottage, snarling ferociously.  The grandmother screamed in fright as the wolf attacked and ate her up in one bite.<br><br>He licked his chops, chuckling wickedly to himself as he dressed himself in the grandmother's bedclothes and hid himself under the covers of her bed.&quot;<br> It is followed by Page 8.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Page 7 is a page.<br> &quot;When Little Red Riding Hood arrived at her grandmother's house, she found her grandmother looking very peculiar.<br><br>'Grandmother!' she cried.

 Example: ** Conversation Trees - How to create dialogue menus with story characters.
<p>
 The menu-based interface makes it very easy to set up a multi-tiered conversation tree where the player can select a subject to talk about, which leads to more available topics, resulting in a more or less natural conversational exchange. This sample game shows how to set up a very simple conversation tree where some choices will simply print a response and return to the same general subject, while others may lead to new subjects altogether.
<p>
 Notice, in particular, the use of pages with no description to hold the choices for the player's end of the conversation. This is so we can return to the same set of choices without interrupting the flow of the conversation by reprinting the statement that initiated them. In this case, we don't want to reprint the introductory text about sitting next to Keith every time we want to change the subject.
<p>
 Notice also how flags can be used to expand the options available on a subject based on what's already been discussed - the question about kissing a sting ray only appears when Keith has mentioned it in the conversation.
<p>
 Finally, we use the flag CARTELDISMISSED to keep track of whether or not Keith has admitted to the player that the story about his drug cartel is a lie. If he's already admitted to deception, it's not likely that he's going to try the same line again or that the player will fall for it, so we provide a different option in the list of subject that takes us right to the part of the conversation about sting rays.

 Example: ** Lockable Door - How to create a door that can be locked or unlocked from the inside or outside by using an inventory item.
<p>
 If we think of an Adventure Book like a traditional piece of interactive fiction, we can imagine certain pages representing the player's current location and his choices taking him from one location to another. We might want an effect where a door is locked and requires a key to open. We may even want to allow him to lock it again with the same key.
<p>
 Here's an example implementation of a door that can be locked and unlocked from both the inside and the outside by using the key. Notice how the uses for the key have conditions to sort between when the player is locking or unlocking the door. Notice also how LockedDoor, LockDoor, and UnlockDoor are reused by the pages on either side of the door.

 Example: ** Adaptive Text - How to change what's written on a page based on the game state.
<p>
 In the original Adventure Book system, every page had a single, static description. One major advantage of using Inform 7 is that you can vary the way a page is written based on how flags are set and whether inventory items are carried. This can be very useful if you have a story where the player visits the same page many times, but it looks slightly different or slightly different things happen based on what has happened previously.
<p>
 In this very simple example, the description of the cat varies depending on whether the player is holding the cat treats.

 Example: *** Winning and Dying - How to add traditional &quot;win&quot; and &quot;die&quot; messages to your games.
<p>
 The Adventure Book extension provides The Last Page as a tidy little &quot;end game&quot; menu that you can use in your stories, but the burden of printing out a message to the player to indicate success or failure falls on the author.
<p>
 Suppose you'd like ending pages that look more like traditional Inform games. This game shows you an example of how you can do just that. Failure and Success are pages that tell the player that he has died or won, respectively. Both choices divert to GameEnd, which displays the usual restart/restore/quit option that Inform provides automatically. We even define an AMUSING choice as a magic word that only works at GameEnd and only if the player has gone through Success.

 Example: **** Combat System - Using the &quot;run inform code for...&quot; phrase to add functionality.
<p>
 Experienced Inform 7 programmers can add a lot of extra behavior to the Adventure Book system by creating custom game commands and overriding the &quot;run inform code for...&quot; phrase.
<p>
 Some traditional adventure books, such as the Fighting Fantasy series, added a combat system and encounters with monsters to make the story feel more like an RPG. This is a very simple example of how we can make special pages that know how to begin a monster encounter and a combat menu that can do more than just turn the player to a different page.

<p>

<p>
 Because this is just an example, we keep the system simple. Attack increased your chances of hitting, hit points represent your life force.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><img border=0 src=../../../doc_images/paste.png> Section 1 - Character Stats</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> People have a number called hit points. People have a number called attack.</font></blockquote>

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> A monster is a kind of person.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Section 2 - Combat</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Here, we create a special kind of page called a combat setting. It keeps track of a lot of information that will be useful when we run combat. The monsterless page is where we turn if there are no monsters currently occupying this page. The victory page is where we turn at the end of a successful combat, where we may grant the player treasures or other boons. The defeat page is where we turn if the player fails in this combat. It is usually The Last Page, but it doesn't have to be; we can create special encounters where combat isn't fatal if the player fails by making it turn to a different page. Finally, the escape page allows us to give a page where the player can turn if he tries to escape. Notice that, if no such page is defined, the player simply bounces back into combat.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><img border=0 src=../../../doc_images/paste.png> A combat setting is a kind of page. A combat setting has a page called the monsterless page. A combat setting has a page called the victory page. A combat setting has a page called the defeat page. A combat setting usually has defeat page The Last Page.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Current Battle is a combat setting that varies. Current Opponent is a monster that varies.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 We define monsters separately from the combat setting where they are found. This would allow us to dynamically change where monsters appear throughout the game.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><img border=0 src=../../../doc_images/paste.png> Inhabiting relates various monsters to one combat setting (called the home). The verb to inhabit (it inhabits, they inhabit, it inhabited, it is inhabited, it is inhabiting) implies the inhabiting relation. The verb to house (it houses, they house, it housed, it is housed, it is housing) implies the reversed inhabiting relation.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Whenever we turn to a combat setting, we first check to see if monsters are about. If not, we go to the monsterless page. If so, we set up our combat variables and go to the combat menu.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><img border=0 src=../../../doc_images/paste.png> To run inform code for (x - a combat setting):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if x is not inhabited by something:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; change pages to the monsterless page of x;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; otherwise:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now Current Battle is x;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now Current Opponent is a random monster that inhabits x;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; read x;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; change pages to CombatMenu;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 CombatMenu is a pretty normal page. CombatAttack is where the real fun happens. Whenever we turn to that page, we roll dice for the player and the monster, add attack bonuses, and compare the results. The winner does 2 points of damage to the loser, and nothing happens in the event of a tie. If either side was defeated, we tell the game to branch to the appropriate page. Otherwise, we jump back to the CombatMenu to try again.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><img border=0 src=../../../doc_images/paste.png> CombatMenu is a page.<br> &quot;Your hit points: [hit points of the player][line break]	[Current Opponent]'s hit points: [hit points of the Current Opponent][paragraph break]	What will you do?&quot;<br> A choice called combatmenua is for CombatMenu. &quot;Attack&quot;.

<p>
 We may want to make the player gain or lose stamina as a result of events in the story beyond combat. So we create properties to keep track of what the page can do to the player's stamina and &quot;run inform code for...&quot; definitions that can carry them out.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><img border=0 src=../../../doc_images/paste.png> Section 3 - Traps</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Pages have a number called hit points. A page usually has hit points 0. A page can be trapped. A page is usually not trapped. A page can be healing. A page is usually not healing.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> To run inform code for (x - a trapped page):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now the hit points of the player is the hit points of the player minus the hit points of the current page;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if the hit points of the player is less than 1:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now the hit points of the player is 0;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; read the current page;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; change pages to The Last Page;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> To run inform code for (x - a healing page):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now the hit points of the player is the hit points of the player plus the hit points of the current page;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if the hit points of the player is greater than 10:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now the hit points of the player is 10;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Finally, we define a new command, &quot;status&quot;, that allows the player to view his hit points at any time.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><img border=0 src=../../../doc_images/paste.png> Section 4 - Status</font></blockquote>

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Checking status is an action applying to nothing. Understand &quot;status&quot; as checking status.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Carry out checking status:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say &quot;[status][paragraph break]&quot;;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> To say status:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say &quot;Current hit points: [the hit points of the player]&quot;;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 And now, an example of how it all comes together. We have one combat setting with two monsters, one room that does damage, and one room that heals.

 Example: **** Placebo! - A complete adventure game in Adventure Book format.
<p>
 Placebo! is an example of how to make a game that behaves more or less like a traditional piece of interactive fiction using the Adventure Book interface. There are commands that allow the player to move between different locations, interact with his surroundings, and acquire and use inventory items. Play through it to see the sorts of effects that are possible with Adventure Book, and read through the code at your own pace to see how it's done. Feel free to adopt or adapt any of the techniques in this story to your own projects.

other.  And, somehow or other, you manage to impale yourself on your sword upon
landing, which is great because that way you're dead slightly before every bone
in your body is broken on impact.<br><br>*** YOU ARE DIED ***&quot;.<br> It is followed by The Last Page.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font color="#000080"> AmusingPage is a page.<br> &quot;It's been at least ten years since I first drew out the map for what would
turn out to be Placebo, my very first adventure game.  I wrote the first version
on a TI-82 graphics calculator when I should have been paying attention to my
high school classes.  The text was terse, and the interface was simple, but I
was damned proud of it.  I had managed to put a text adventure on a system that
didn't even allow for string variables.<br><br>I've reworked and expanded the game for Jon Ingold's Adventure Book as an
exercise with the system, and it's been a delightful experience.  It is, in many
ways, much more satisfying than working with a full-blown programming language,
or even with a game-specific language such as Inform.  My only regret is that
this project barely scratches the surface of what's possible with the system --
Kingdom Without End is a tough act to follow.&quot;<br> It is followed by Amusing2.</font></blockquote>

magic wand?  Did you try offering a sack of gold or a lesser magic to the
bartender in exchange for his information?  Did you know there are three basic
decision branches (which converge toward the end) that let you beat the Mad
Hermit?<br><br>I hope the game gave you a giggle.  Now choose your ending.&quot;<br> It is followed by EndingChoices.</font></blockquote>
