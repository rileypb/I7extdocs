 expands Chapter 9.11 &quot;Future Events&quot;
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> (event) on turn (number)</font></blockquote>
<p>
 The phrase &quot;if (event) is soon&quot; asks if the event is currently scheduled, while &quot;never shall (event)&quot; will un-schedule the event. The phrase &quot;if (event) is this turn&quot; asks if the event is firing on that very turn. The latter is useful as a signpost to begin or end scenes, as well as for combining output from the event's rule into, say, a room description. For the if-phrases, &quot;is&quot; is optional.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><img border=0 src=../../../doc_images/paste.png> Instead of saying no, I run the daily TPS reports at 6 PM.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> At the time when I run the daily TPS reports: do nothing.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> When play begins, your last chance passes you by on turn 5.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Carry out eating your agenda: never shall I run the daily TPS reports.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The rest of your life is a scene.<br> The rest of your life begins when your last chance passes you by this turn.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Your new life is a scene.<br> Your new life begins when we have eaten your agenda.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 The phrases &quot;the time since a scene began/ended&quot; and similar for &quot;the time when a scene began/ended&quot; presented in 10.3 &quot;Using the Scene Index&quot; now accept a description of scenes. For example, 10.4. &quot;During Scenes&quot; applies adjectives such as &quot;dull&quot; to scenes. (Note the use of &quot;the scene being referenced&quot; that mirrors the built-in &quot;scene being changed&quot;.)
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><img border=0 src=../../../doc_images/paste.png> Every turn when the time since a new scene began is four minutes<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say &quot;It's been four whole minutes since a new scene, [the scene being referenced], began. So get a move on!&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Definition: a scene is new if it has happened.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Similar phrases for events now exist, but because we'll be talking about moments in the future rather than the past, we use &quot;until&quot; in lieu of &quot;since&quot;. And again, we may get the measurement in either turns or time.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><img border=0 src=../../../doc_images/paste.png> Every turn (this is the event debugging rule):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; repeat with E running through future events:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say &quot;The turn when [E]:  the [the turn when E]th turn.&quot;;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say &quot;The time when [E]:  [the time when E].&quot;;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say &quot;The turns until [E]:  [the turns until E] turn[s].&quot;;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say &quot;The time until [E]:  [the time until E].&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 The say phrase &quot;as a time period&quot; answers section 16.9 &quot;Understanding kinds of value&quot; in that it will print the time as a duration such as three hours and thirty minutes, rather than 3:30 PM.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><img border=0 src=../../../doc_images/paste.png> Understand &quot;wait for [a time period]&quot; as a mistake (&quot;'But [the time understood as a time period] is so long!'&quot;).</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Understand &quot;wait until [a time]&quot; as a mistake (&quot;'But that's [the time understood minus the time of day as a time period]!'&quot;).</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Test me with &quot;wait for 3 minutes / wait until 3:30 pm&quot;.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Normally, one turn takes one minute of simulated game time. We can alter this ratio with phrases like &quot;60 turns per minute&quot;, in which each turn would take one second, and &quot;30 minutes per turn&quot;, in which each turn would take a half hour. We can retrieve this information with &quot;minutes per turn&quot; and &quot;turns per minute&quot;, which are handy for converting between the minute and turn scales via multiplication. A value of zero puts time at a standstill.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><img border=0 src=../../../doc_images/paste.png> Understand &quot;ratio&quot; as a mistake (&quot;[turns per minute in words] turn[s] per minute[line break][minutes per turn as a time period] per turn&quot;).</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Instead of drinking the Red Bull: four turns per minute.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Instead of sleeping when turns per minute is at least two, (turns per minute minus one) turns per minute.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Report examining the extension: say &quot;'Well that only took [20 minutes divided by the turns per minute as a time period].'&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 This extension allows us to have Scenes begin or end when a timed event happens. From section 9.11 on Timed Events:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><img border=0 src=../../../doc_images/paste.png> An egg-timer is in the kitchen. &quot;A plastic egg timer in the shape of a chicken can be pressed to set it going.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Instead of pushing the egg-timer: say &quot;It begins to mark time.&quot;; the egg-timer clucks in four turns from now.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> At the time when the egg-timer clucks: say &quot;Cluck! Cluck! Cluck! says the egg-timer.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 We can then write a scene to begin (or end) on that event:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><img border=0 src=../../../doc_images/paste.png> Dinnertime is a scene.<br> Dinnertime begins when the turn count is at least 2 and the egg-timer clucks this turn.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Example: * Dinnertime - Schedules a future event, and begins a scene when it happens
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><img border=0 src=../../../doc_images/paste.png> &quot;Dinnertime&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Include Phrases for Adaptive Pacing by Ron Newcomb.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The kitchen is a room.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> An egg-timer is in the kitchen. &quot;A plastic egg timer in the shape of a chicken can be pressed to set it going.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Instead of pushing the egg-timer: say &quot;It begins to mark time.&quot;; the egg-timer clucks in four turns from now.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> At the time when the egg-timer clucks: say &quot;'Cluck! Cluck! Cluck!' says the egg-timer.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Test me with &quot;scenes / push egg-timer / z / z/ z/ z/ z/ z/ z/ z/ z/ z&quot;.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Dinnertime is a scene.<br> Dinnertime begins when the turn count is at least two and the egg-timer clucks this turn.<br> When dinnertime begins: say &quot;The most wonderful scents fill the air.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Example: ** Life Ticking Away - Demonstrates the many phrases.
<p>
 Try &quot;test me&quot; for most of the time until/when phrases, &quot;test wait&quot; for how various waiting actions could work, or &quot;test ratio&quot; for testing the turns-to-minutes ratio via some caffeinated assistance.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><img border=0 src=../../../doc_images/paste.png> &quot;Life Ticking Away&quot;</font></blockquote>
