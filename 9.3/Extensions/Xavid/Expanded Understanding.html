<p>
 This extension makes various tweaks to understand additional variations of commands and have cleverer, more specific error messages in common failure cases.
<p>
 It requires and includes the related Small Kindnesses by Aaron Reed. It depends on Snippetage by Dave Robinson and Object Matching by Xavid for implementation details.
<p>
 Some enhancements are specific to use with Approaches by Emily Short (including one to improve interaction with Simple Followers by Emily Short).
<p>
 Part 1 - Command Tweaks
<p>
 Chapter 1 - Aliases
<p>
 This extension provides aliases to make commands the player might type work.
<p>
 The command &quot;remove&quot; can mean taking something in a container (in addition to taking off something you're wearing).
<p>
 &quot;Set fire to&quot; means to burn.
<p>
 &quot;Leave [room]&quot; means to go outside, whether or not you actually can; you'll get the same error message as if you typed &quot;outside&quot;.
<p>
 Chapter 2 - Remapped Commands
<p>
 We interpret &quot;search&quot; as examining a thing or room, on the assumption that this will show something's contents and is more likely to be correctly modified for things with special description rules.
<p>
 Chapter 3 - Modified Commands
<p>
 Section 1 - Examining Tweaks
<p>
 This raises the priority of things when examining so that, in the common case where there's a scenery thing in a room with a similar name, the thing wins. (Examining rooms is enabled by the required Small Kindnesses by Aaron Reed.)
<p>
 You can set this for individual things by saying:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The river is visible from a distance.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 To change the default for, say, scenery:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> A scenery thing is usually visible from a distance.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Section 2 - Entering
<p>
 The Standard Rules defines an enter variation with no object. We get rid of this so that you get the parenthetical message about what you're entering when entering something without specifying it specifically.
<p>
 Part 2 - Cleverer Error Messages
<p>
 This extension attempts to improve some error messages in a few common cases when players refer to nouns that aren't available.
<p>
 Chapter 1 - Examining
<p>
 If the player tries to examine something that's not here but they've seen before, this extension reminds them where they last saw it. (This functionality is inspired by Remembering by Aaron Reed but is implemented differently to avoid modifying the understanding of commands that aren't errors.)
<p>
 To make natural messages about things being in rooms, we give rooms a property called the &quot;at preposition&quot;. This is &quot;at&quot; by default for messages like &quot;You last saw it at the river.&quot; but can be set to, say, &quot;in&quot; for indoor rooms. In addition, you can have rooms be improper-named for these messages to use lower case and the article &quot;the&quot;.
<p>
 In addition, the error messages are reworked to use the specific words typed by the player in some cases.
<p>
 Chapter 2 - Taking and Dropping
<p>
 We similarly use remembering and specific words for error messages from taking and dropping action.
<p>
 Chapter 3 - All
<p>
 Section 1 - General
<p>
 We have more specific error messages for commands with all where nothing matches (e.g., take all when there's nothing here or drop all when you're not holding anything) to replace the default &quot;There are none at all available!&quot; The new messages are specifically based on the action the player was trying to take.
<p>
 Section 2 - Drop All
<p>
 By default, the standard rules provide several variations of drop that allow multiple things; in addition to the basic &quot;drop all&quot;, you can also do &quot;drop all into box&quot; or &quot;drop all onto table&quot;. The problem is that if you do &quot;drop all&quot; when you aren't holding anything, you get a clarification message appropriate to one of those unusual variations like &quot;What do you want to drop those things in?&quot;, which is confusing. To avoid this, we disable clarification for dropping all when the actor isn't holding anything.
<p>
 Section 3 - Limiting All
<p>
 Inform uses &quot;whether all includes&quot; rules to, e.g., include scenery from &quot;take all&quot;. Unfortunately, as defined in the Standard Rules these rules apply just to the player, not other actors. We provide versions of the same rules for any actor.
<p>
 Part 3 - Conversation
<p>
 We add several variations of &quot;tell someone to do something&quot; as an alternative to &quot;someone, do something&quot;. We also understand a command that starts with someone's name as an order even if the comma is left off (if the name is one word long).
<p>
 We add &quot;tell someone that something&quot; as an alternative to &quot;answer&quot;.
<p>
 We also understand &quot;remind someone that something&quot; as &quot;someone, remember something&quot;. Remember isn't actually understood by default, but you can either make it a command or handle this with &quot;answer someone that&quot; -based rules.
<p>
 Part 4 - Improvements with Approaches by Emily Short
<p>
 We allow the player to go to a visited room by going to the name of a fixed in place or scenery thing in that room, using it as a landmark, instead of just the room name.
<p>
 We display the direction traveled even when going to an adjacent room to be more explicit.
<p>
 We improve error messages to use the &quot;at preposition&quot; property described above.
<p>
 We also improve its compatibility with Simple Followers (also by Emily Short), so you don't leave people behind when to travel long distances with &quot;go to&quot;.
<p>
 Part 5 - Improvements with Implicit Actions by Eric Eve
<p>
 We allow NPCs to implicitly take things, which is normally allowed by the Standard Rules but is disabled with the Implicit Actions extension (which is otherwise great because it improves error messages when you try to implicitly take something but can't).
<p>
 In addition, we fix an extra line break that normally shows up after the failure-to-take message when you try and fail to implicitly take something.
<p>
