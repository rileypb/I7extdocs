<p>
 The standard behaviour for Inform 7 is to advance the time of day by one minute for each turn taken. There may be times when we'd like to vary this, perhaps because the player is up against a timed puzzle but we don't want certain actions to count too heavily against that time, or because we don't want our story to reach dawn or dusk too fast. This extension allows us to change the time taken per turn both on a global basis and for individual actions.
<p>
 The passage of time per turn can be changed by changing the global variable seconds_per_turn (which is 60 by default). E. g. if we wanted two turns per minute, we could define:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> now seconds_per_turn is 30</font></blockquote>
<p>
 To make individual actions take something other than this standard time we can use the phrases:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> take n secs/sec/seconds/second<br> take n secs/sec/seconds/second in/-- all/total/only</font></blockquote>
<p>
 For example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> take 3 secs<br> take 1 sec<br> take 20 secs in all</font></blockquote>
<p>
 These phrases can be used in any of the rules relating to the action (or anything used by any of those rules, such as &quot;to&quot; or &quot;to say&quot; phrase). The difference between the two forms &quot;take n secs&quot; and &quot;take n secs in all&quot; is that the first is additive and the second is not. That means that if an action triggers several rules, and more than one of these rules contains a &quot;take n secs&quot; phrase, the time from each of them will be added to the action, whereas if the phrase &quot;take n secs only&quot; (or one of its variants) is encountered in a rule, then the action will take this number of seconds, the time from previous rules for that action being ignored.
<p>
 Equivalent to say phrases are also available, e.g.:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> &quot;[3 secs]&quot;<br> &quot;[20 secs total]&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 This makes it easy to write rules like:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Instead of taking the delicate vase in the presence of Aunt Veronica:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say &quot;[2 secs]Aunt Veronica's ferocius glare warns you to leave the vase well alone.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> After dropping the knife:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say &quot;[1 sec total]The knife falls from your grasp and clatters on the floor.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 With all the above phrases, the turn count will still be increased by one. To have no time taken at all and the turn count not advanced, we can use the phrases:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> take no time<br> &quot;[no-time]&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 This can be especially useful when the response to an action is effectively a refusal to act, and we don't want the refusal to count either against the elapsed time or the turn count. For example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Instead of taking Nelson's Column:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say &quot;[no-time]You lack the strength to lift it.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Or, more generally:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Check taking something fixed in place: take no time.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Finally the phrase &quot;[sec-time]&quot; can be used to display the time of day in the format hh: mm: ss am/pm, for example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><img border=0 src=../../doc_images/paste.png> When play begins: now the right hand status line is &quot;    [sec-time]&quot;;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Note that internally, the variable time of day is still only held to the nearest minute. This extension keeps track of a second variable, called seconds, which is used to decide when the time of day should be advanced.
<p>
 One further note: where the various phrases defined above have potentially contradictory effects (e.g. take no time and take 5 seconds used on the same turn), it's the last phrase executed that takes effect.
<p>
 Example: * Museum of Curiosities - Actions taking variable amounts of time.
<p>
 In this example we make each turn take 30 seconds by default, but change this for certain actions. Here we'll assume that taking or dropping something normally only takes 1 second, and that taking inventory takes 1 second, so we write additional carry out rules accordingly. Since various actions with the exhibits are forbidden altogether, we won't let attempting them take any time at all, or even any turns. Various objects take various lengths of time to examine (depending on the amount of detail to be absorbed), so we'll use &quot;[n secs]&quot; phrases in their descriptions to vary the length of time taken to look at them. Finally, we'll make the bag of crisps awkward to take the first time, and override the standard 1 second taking time with &quot;[40 secs in all]&quot;.
<p>
 A test script is provided, but you may find it runs too fast for you to see what's going on. It may be more useful to enter commands manually, one at a time, and watch the status line to see the effect.
