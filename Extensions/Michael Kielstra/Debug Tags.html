 Section: Using Debug Tags
<p>
 Many programmers now use debug tags, also known as comment tags, to mark points in their code that need attention. This extension adds a way of doing this in Inform that is scriptable, manageable, and, most importantly, doesn't mess up released code.
<p>
 A debug tag is just an object like anything else. We create one thusly:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><img border=0 src=../../doc_images/paste.png> CANNOT OPEN DOOR is a debug tag.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 However, we generally don't refer directly to debug tags. Instead, we create different types, for ease of reference:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><img border=0 src=../../doc_images/paste.png> CANNOT OPEN DOOR is a FIXME.<br> IMPLEMENT DOOR OPENING MECHANISM is a TODO.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Both these tag types are defined by the extension. A list of all such predefined tag types is given in a later section.
<p>
 When the game starts, we will be given a list of all debug tags. With default settings, the previous example would generate the following:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> DO NOT RELEASE: SERIOUSLY INCOMPLETE<br> STOPSHIP: CANNOT OPEN DOOR.<br> TODO: IMPLEMENT DOOR OPENING MECHANISM.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Note that the FIXME tag calls itself a STOPSHIP. Tags have control over what they call themselves (called the type of the tag), and we try to keep the number of different reported types for tags down to a minimum for easy reading, even as more and more different actual types are defined. (STOPSHIP and FIXME, for instance, are both valid kinds of tags with type &quot;STOPSHIP&quot;.)
<p>
 During the game, the command TAGS will reprint the list of debug tags for convenience. Tags are automatically moved to nowhere at the beginning of released games, and the printout will not appear.
<p>
 Section: Advanced Usage and Creating Debug Tags
<p>
 Tags can be put in locations. This will be reported at game start, and provides an Inform-friendly way of reminding yourself where the problem is. Example B uses this. Tags are scenery, so they shouldn't affect beta-testing much.
<p>
 Each tag also has an assignee. This is just a text field for the name of who should be fixing the bug or implementing the feature. Example B demonstrates this.
<p>
 Finally, each tag has a priority. Smaller numbers mean more serious bugs. Normal tags are at 100 by default; &quot;serious&quot; tags like STOPSHIP and FIXME are at 10. By default, having any tags with priority of 99 or higher will cause a &quot;DO NOT RELEASE&quot; message to be displayed at the beginning of the game. The urgent tags message, the priority of each tag, and the urgency threshold can all be overridden. Example B demonstrates how, and the relevant lines are repeated here:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><img border=0 src=../../doc_images/paste.png> An unimplemented object is a kind of debug tag. The priority of an unimplemented object is usually 1.<br> The urgent tags message is &quot;Some F-35 systems not fully implemented.&quot;<br> The urgency threshold is 5.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 This will cause unimplemented objects, but not serious tags, to cause an urgent tags message to be shown. If you don't want the message to ever be shown, set the urgency threshold to -1. If you set it to 0, it will be reset to 99.
<p>
 Tags are always printed sorted in priority order, lowest first.
<p>
 Section: Defaults and Predefined Debug Tags
<p>
 The default urgent message is &quot;DO NOT RELEASE: SERIOUSLY INCOMPLETE&quot;. The default urgent threshold is 99 -- tags with priority of 100 or lower will not cause the message to be printed.
<p>
 Predefined serious tags (&quot;STOPSHIP&quot;):
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> STOPSHIP<br> FIXME<br> BUG</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Predefined standard tags (&quot;TODO&quot;):
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> TODO<br> XXX<br> HACK<br> NOTE<br> QUESTION<br> ALERT<br> CAVEAT<br> IDEA</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Example: * The Lab - A basic example.
<p>
 We'd like to implement a chemistry lab, so we go ahead and create a lab and a lab bench. Immediately, we have some great ideas, but we don't know quite what to do with them so we write them down to come back to later. A quick test reveals a serious bug, but we want to keep putting the lab together so we note it down to fix later. We make it a STOPSHIP so it has a higher priority, meaning that it will be printed first when we next run the game.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><img border=0 src=../../doc_images/paste.png> &quot;The Lab&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Include Debug Tags by Michael Kielstra.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The Lab is a room. The lab bench is in the Lab. The chemical box is in the lab. It is an openable open container. The chemical phial is in the chemical box.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> IMPLEMENT CHEMICAL MIXING/ALCHEMY SYSTEM is a TODO.<br> MAYBE ADD SOME PHENOLPHTHALEIN - I LOVE PHENOLPHTHALEIN is an IDEA.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> PLAYER CANNOT PUT PHIAL ON LAB BENCH is a STOPSHIP.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Test me with &quot;take phial / put chemical phial on lab bench&quot;.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Example: * The Jet - A more complex example with priorities, urgency overriding, an assignee, and custom messages.
<p>
 We're implementing a fighter jet, but someone's linked the controls together strangely. Plus, the missiles don't work. The first of these problems is something we can fix right now, but the second's really more Iceman's responsability than ours, so we make a note. The next time he runs our development copy of the game, he'll see we've assigned the guidance to him.
<p>
 Difficult-to-understand controls for complex machines are almost a tradition of IF, so we don't worry particularly about our ignition/self-destruct problem. It shouldn't go out to the public, so we make it a STOPSHIP, but the only bug we're properly worried about is the complete lack of missile implementation. To give this a higher priority, we create a new type of tag in case this kind of thing comes up in the future, and give it a more serious (numerically lower) priority. We make the urgency threshold more serious as well, so only our new kind of tag causes the urgent message.
<p>
 Since we've now got a more concrete use for the urgent tags message, we give a more specific piece of text for it instead of the usual warning, and, just for quality-of-life and because we can, we tell the game to stop prefixing STOPSHIP tags with &quot;STOPSHIP&quot; and use &quot;Doesn't work&quot; instead.
