<p>
 Section: The Marked Visible Property
<p>
 Scope Caching creates a property for things called &quot;marked visible.&quot; This is equivalent to the &quot;visible&quot; adjective, except it is calculated only at specific times and then stored, trading storage space for speed.
<p>
 These conditions:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> the player can see the ball</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> the ball is visible</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Will normally mean the same as:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> the ball is marked visible</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Section: The Caching Scope Activity
<p>
 If circumstances change during a turn and we need to check scope again, or if we want to check scope for something other than the player, we need to refresh the cache. We can do this with the &quot;caching scope&quot; activity:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Before Bob trying doing something:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; carry out the caching scope activity with Bob</font></blockquote>
<p>
 This will, of course, leave the &quot;marked visible&quot; property set for Bob, so if we need to check the player's scope again, we need to run the phrase an additional time.
<p>
 Section: The Cache Scope After Reading a Command Rule
<p>
 This is the rule which normally sets the &quot;marked visible&quot; property each turn:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> After reading a command (this is the cache scope after reading a command rule):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; carry out the caching scope activity with the player.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 It's listed first in the &quot;after reading a command&quot; rulebook, so other &quot;after reading a command&quot; rules should be able to make use of the &quot;marked visible&quot; property.
<p>
 Section: When the Visibility of One Thing Depends On Another
<p>
 Perhaps this sort of test will always be tricky, but the way scope is implemented in Inform seems to make it particularly so. We must take pains to perform the visibility test at the right time:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> After deciding the scope of the player when not caching scope:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If no nose is marked visible:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; place your nose in scope;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now your nose is marked visible.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Scope caching normally happens before any parsing begins, so any noses present will be marked before this rule sees them. The &quot;deciding the scope&quot; activity does run during parsing (often several times), we will get what we want, when we want it. But we must manually make your nose &quot;marked visible&quot; because caching scope is obviously not taking place! We might choose not to do that if we had multiple grammar lines depending on the same rule.
<p>
 Section: Trusting The Scope Cache
<p>
 If we know for a fact that nothing will change until next turn, we can speed things up a bit by saying:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Trust the scope cache until next turn.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 This will suppress scope caching after reading a command on the next turn.
<p>
 If we change our minds later in the turn, we can say:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Mistrust the scope cache.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 And things will be back to normal.
<p>
 Section: Interactions with Other Extensions
<p>
 Scope Caching optimizes the setting of the &quot;seen&quot; property in Eric Eve's Epistemology and the &quot;remembered location&quot; property in Aaron Reed's &quot;Remembering&quot; extension.
<p>
 It also interacts with Mike Ciul's Conditional Backdrops extension. After the &quot;moving floating objects&quot; activity takes place, we &quot;trust the scope cache until next turn,&quot; on the assumption that going (and other actions that change the landscape of backdrops and doors) will be the only thing that affects scope until next turn. If we discover that this is not the case, we must &quot;mistrust the scope cache&quot; manually:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> After moving floating objects when the Energizer Bunny is on the move (this is the expecting the bunny to move rule):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mistrust the scope cache;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The expecting the bunny to move rule is listed after the cache scope after moving floating objects rule in the after moving floating objects rulebook.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Or we could just take care of the scope caching ourselves when the change actually happens:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Every turn when the bunny is switched on (this is the move the bunny rule):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the bunny is in the next destination of the bunny;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cache scope for the player;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trust the scope cache until next turn.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Section: Testing Commands
<p>
 We can use the &quot;scopestat&quot; command to find out what items are currently marked visible. The command by itself will list the items marked visible for the player, while &quot;scopestat [any thing]&quot; will list the items visible for another person.
<p>
 Example: * Which Rubber - Uses Scope Caching to prevent an infinite loop. Without it, the &quot;After deciding the scope of the player&quot; rule repeats forever.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><img border=0 src=../../doc_images/paste.png> &quot;Which Rubber&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Include Scope Caching by Mike Ciul.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Indoors is a room.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The front door is a door. It is west of Indoors and east of Outdoors.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Bob is a man in Outdoors.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> There is a container called a pile of balls in Indoors. &quot;There is a pile of rubber balls here.&quot; In the pile is a ball.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Understand &quot;rubber&quot; as a pile when the ball is not marked visible.<br> Understand &quot;rubber&quot; as a ball when the ball is marked visible.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The outdoor view is scenery. The description is &quot;It's bright outside.&quot;;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> After deciding the scope of the player in Indoors when the front door is open:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; place the outdoor view in scope.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Test me with &quot;rules/open door/get rubber/scopestat/scopestat bob&quot;</font></blockquote>
