<p>
 This extension lets us log messages from any point in your Inform7 code by doing something as simple as &quot;debug 'Whatever message';&quot;.
<p>
 The message will then appear in the transcript as &quot;(Default logger, turn 1, debug level): Whatever message&quot;
<p>
 For some more control, you can use different predefined log levels. These use the severity kind defined in the extension Developer Framework. You can use those to log something at a specified severity:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> log &quot;this is logged as information.&quot; at info level.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 When you do this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> debug &quot;This is a debug message.&quot;;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 That is really just a shortcut for doing this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> log message &quot;This is a debug message.&quot; at debug level to the default logger;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 There are such shortcuts for all four log levels, so you can just do any of these:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> debug &quot;This is a message&quot;;<br> info &quot;This is a message&quot;;<br> warn &quot;This is a message&quot;;<br> error &quot;This is a message&quot;;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 There are some different ways we can control what gets logged where: defining levels, and deciding whether to log to console or file, and setting up different loggers with different configurations.
<p>
 Section: Controlling the log level
<p>
 You can control the minimum level at which log messages are shown:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> now the level of the default logger is warning level.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 That line means that only warnings and errors are displayed, while debug and info messages are silently ignored (because we are logging anything that is at least as severe as a warning).
<p>
 We can log at four different levels of increasing severity: debug level, info level, warning level and error level.
<p>
 For the completist, there are two additional severities: off level and every level. We can't log messages at &quot;off&quot; or &quot;every&quot; level, but we can use those for setting the levels of the loggers.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> now the level of the default logger is every level.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Although in practice it doesn't matter whether we use &quot;every level&quot; or &quot;debug level&quot; (since there is no lower level), and the same for &quot;error level&quot; and &quot;every level&quot; - there is no higher level than error, so it's the same thing.
<p>
 These work as expected: setting the log level to off level turns all logging off, every level turns all logging on.
<p>
 Section: Logging to console
<p>
 Logging to console just means that we &quot;say&quot; the log messages (with a bit of preamble that makes it clear that this is a log message).
<p>
 We can turn console logging on and off:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> now the default logger does not log to console</font></blockquote>
<p>
 or
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> now the default logger logs to console</font></blockquote>
<p>
 The difference between setting the level to off level and turning off console logging is that, well, they're different things. For example, if we set the level to warning level, turn on file logging, and turn off console logging, we are going to get warnings and errors in the file log, but nothing in the console.
<p>
 Section: Logging to file
<p>
 Logging to file only works if we are using Glulx - not Z-machine.
<p>
 By default, nothing is logged to file, so we need to turn it on:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> now the default logger is logging to file.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 By default, the logs will end up in a file in the root of our project (where the projectname.inform and projectname.materials folders live). The default file name is informlog.glkdata. If we wish to rename it we can do that like this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The File of Custom Logging is &quot;myCustomLog&quot;;<br> when play begins:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now the logging file is the File of Custom Logging.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 On a linux system like Mac, in a terminal, we can do
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> tail -f informlog.glkdata</font></blockquote>
<p>
 and see the file logs appearing in the terminal window while we play in the Inform app.
<p>
 Allegedly we can do something similar on Windows using PowerShell:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Get-Content. \informlog.glkdata -Tail</font></blockquote>
<p>
 There is no need to create this file manually, it should be done by Inform, but if we're using it for a long time, eventually the file will become large. Then we can just delete it, or rename it, etc.
<p>
 Section: Using multiple loggers
<p>
 We can create different loggers for different parts of your code, or different things in the game world.
<p>
 Creating a new logger is simple:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The laser log is a logger.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 We can then configure that just like the default logger:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The level of the laser log is warning level.<br> The laser log is not logging to file.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 And when something happens in the game that relates to that feature, we log to it:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> info to laser log saying &quot;The user is in [the location of the player] fiddling with a laser.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Section: updating to version 3
<p>
 Before version 3, there were two different levels for console and log. You would then say
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> now file log level is every level</font></blockquote>
<p>
 If we really just want to log everything to file, the version 3 equivalent is setting the level and turning on and off file and console logging (and perhaps using multiple loggers).
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> now the default logger is logging to file;<br> now the level of the default logger is every level;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 If you were using that feature to have different log levels (e.g. only getting warnings and errors on file, but getting everything in console), we either need to rethink the strategy or do something creative.
<p>
 If anybody needs that feature, or has any other problems or feedback, please let the author (peterorme6@gmail.com) know.
<p>
 Example: * Hello log - A minimal example. Just include and &quot;debug&quot;, &quot;warn&quot; etc.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><img border=0 src=../../doc_images/paste.png> &quot;Hello logger&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Include Flexible Logger by Peter Orme.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> There is a room.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> When play begins:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; debug &quot;Hello log!&quot;;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; warn &quot;This is a warning.&quot;;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Example: ** Controlled Logging - an example with some more features.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><img border=0 src=../../doc_images/paste.png> &quot;Don't forget the fridge!&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Include Flexible Logger by Peter Orme.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The Kitchen is a room.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The Fridge is a fixed in place openable closed container in the Kitchen.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The temperature logger is a logger.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The Living Room is room. It is south from the Kitchen.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> After going to the Living Room when the fridge is open:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; debug to the temperature logger saying &quot;Leaving the kitchen with the door open.&quot;;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Test me with &quot;open fridge / go south&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 When we test this, we should see the debug log about leaving the fridge door open. Let's pretend we have a big project with lots of logging going on, and we have been following this pattern of using different loggers for different things. In this case, it's not specific to the fridge, but there's some sort of temperature puzzle going on, and we have all the log messages related to that going to the &quot;temperature logger&quot;. Ok, let's say we're not done with that, but there's something else wrong with the cat control puzzle. OK, easy: we just mute the low-severity logging about the temperature:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The level of the temperature logger is error level.</font></blockquote>
<p>
