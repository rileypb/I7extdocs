<p>
 This extension allows us to directly change the parts of a stored action.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The standing orders are a stored action that varies.<br> The soldier on point is a person that varies.<br> Guarding it from is an action applying to one room and one direction.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> change the action name part of the standing orders to the guarding it from action;<br> change the actor part of the standing orders to the soldier on point;<br> change the noun part of the standing orders to the battlefield;<br> change the second noun part of the standing orders to north;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 This extension also exposes a few new parts of a stored action. The request and numerical parts can be changed in the same way as the earlier four. The rest can only be read.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> request part of S<br> text part of S<br> preposition part of S<br> participle part of S<br> number part of S<br> second number part of S</font></blockquote>
<p>
 The request part is an either/or property that differentiates between &quot;Bob jumping&quot; and &quot;asking Bob to try jumping&quot;. (The latter rule, if executed, would first consult the persuasion rules. It is not referring to either of the asking actions in the Standard Rules &quot;asking it for&quot; nor &quot;asking it about&quot;.)
<p>
 The text part is only of interest to actions which apply to a topic. The text part stores the player's entire command, not just the topic part. If the action name part of a stored action is changed, this obviously invalidates the text part.
<p>
 The preposition part returns the preposition used between the two nouns, for those actions that apply to two nouns. For example, the &quot;telling it about&quot; action has &quot;about&quot; as its preposition. Similarly, the participle part would be &quot;telling&quot;. These two parts may be used on just the action name (such as &quot;the giving it to action&quot;) in addition to a stored action.
<p>
 The number and second number part are for actions that apply to a number or kind of value. Actions can only apply to a single number or kind of value, never two, but if an action also applies to an object, the number part may be first or second. We can test if a noun or second noun is an object by the phrases.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><img border=0 src=../../doc_images/paste.png> if the noun part of (a stored action) is an object,<br> if the second noun part of (a stored action) is an object,</font></blockquote>
<p>
 For the phrases that return the participle, preposition, or whether or not a noun is an object, we may also use an action name instead of a stored action. This is because the returned information is constant, not depending upon a particular instance. For example:<blockquote><font color="#000080"> say &quot;[the preposition of the asking it for action]&quot;;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> unless the second noun part of the dialing it for action is an object:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say &quot;[the second number part of the current action]&quot;;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 A final, small feature: we may ask if a stored action involves a particular action name (i.e., if it involves a particular verb). There are easier, more direct ways to do this, except if the action name is in a variable.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> let the possibility be a random action name;<br> if the best idea yet involves the possibility:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say &quot;And suddenly, a hope; a connection.  [The best idea yet] may fall within your realm of possibilities.&quot;;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 The phrasebook of the index lists these phrases succinctly.
<p>
 Example: * The Ultimate Puzzle Solution - A kind of value's not-so-kind example

<blockquote><font color="#000080"><img border=0 src=../../doc_images/paste.png> &quot;The Ultimate Puzzle Solution&quot;</font></blockquote>

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Feet are a kind of value. 10' specifies feet.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Throwing it is an action applying to one object and one feet.<br> Understand &quot;throw [something] [feet]&quot; as throwing it.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Pent-up frustration is a stored action that varies.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Report throwing it:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now pent-up frustration is the current action;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; change the second feet part of pent-up frustration to the feet understood plus 10';<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say &quot;Although [the current action] was all you intended, you find yourself [pent-up frustration] instead.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Test me with &quot;throw rubik's cube 30['] &quot;</font></blockquote>
