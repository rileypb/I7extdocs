<p>
 This extension allows you to have a window with a map image in it, and to draw icons on the map based on the location of the player or whatever other things you want.
<p>
 It requires Flexible Windows by Jon Ingold.
<p>
 Chapter 1 - Usage
<p>
 Section 1 - A Map
<p>
 To use this extension, you must first create a map image. You can make it in the graphics program of your choice, such as Inkscape, or with Inform's built-in map functionality. Either way, the map can be as elaborate as you want, but rooms should be based around a regular grid. Save your map image to the Figures directory of your materials directory. Import this as a figure called Map with something like:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Figure of Map is the file &quot;Map.png&quot;.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 You also need to tell Graphical Map some information about the map that it can use for layout: the width and height of the image, the distance between the upper left corners of the rooms in your grid, and the padding, the horizontal and vertical distance from the upper left of your image to the top left of the room grid. All distances are in pixels.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The map grid size is 50.<br> The map padding is { 20, 10 }.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 About the room grid: this extension assumes that the rooms in your map are assigned to adjacent squares that are all the same size. The image doesn't have to draw them as squares, of course, but the extension will treat them as squares for purposes of placing map icons (for the PC and so on). If, like Inform's Index map, your map has lines connecting rooms instead of placing them adjacent to each other, you should include the space for those connectors in the map grid size.
<p>
 The map window isn't shown by default, in case you want to have some introductory sequence before it appears. To make it visible, you can do something like:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> When play begins:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open the map window.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Section 2 - Rooms
<p>
 The above is enough to display a static map. But to draw things on it, first we need to know what space in the map grid each Inform room corresponds to. We do this by setting the grid position of a room to its horizontal and vertical position in the map grid, for example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The grid position of the Crossroads is { 3, 1 }.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 This puts the room in the third column and first row on the map.
<p>
 (If you want the upper left space in the map grid be { 0, 0 } instead of { 1, 1 }, you can add the &quot;Use zero-based map grid.&quot; option.)
<p>
 Section 3 - Mapping Things
<p>
 To have the player show up on the map, you also need to make an icon to represent them. This also needs to be declared as a figure. It should generally be a PNG with a transparent background so it looks good overlaid on the map. You assign this figure as the map icon of the player. You also need to define the map offset of the player, the horizontal and vertical distance from the top left of a room to where the icon should appear.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The map icon of yourself is the Figure of PC.<br> The map offset of yourself is { 25, 12 }.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 You can assign map icons and map offsets to anything, not just the PC. Giving different things different map offsets will allow them to appear in the same room without the icons being on top of each other.
<p>
 Section 4 - Mapping Doors
<p>
 Doors are another thing you might want to be indicated on your map. Doors work a little differently than other things. Because they're not really in a single room, the map offset of a door is relative to the overall map grid, not a particular room. Also, a door is only drawn when the door is closed, not when it's open.
<p>
 Section 5 - Exploration
<p>
 By default, the whole map is visible from the start of game. If your game is exploration-based, you may want to hide rooms that have not been visited. Basic support for this functionality can be obtained with:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Use hide unvisited rooms in map.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 This just erases the map grid corresponding to any unvisited room.
<p>
 To make this work nicely when you have connector lines between rooms in your map, you should calculate the map padding so that the rooms on your map image are centered in the boxes of the map grid, and thus half of each connector is in the box for each of the connected rooms. (It's ok if the map padding needs to be negative to accomplish this.)
<p>
 Section 6 - Scrolling
<p>
 Many games may have a map too big to display all at once. If the map is taller than conveniently fits on the screen all at once, you should give the map window an explicit height with something like:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The measurement of the map window is 100.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 The map will automatically scroll around to keep the room the player is currently in centered. The same applies if the map image is wider than fits in the window.
<p>
 The map always scrolls when the hide unvisited rooms in map option is active, to avoid spoiling the fact that the player's at the edge of the map.
<p>
 If you want to disable scrolling, for example because you use a wide map image to avoid white bars on the edge for wider screens but it's fine for the edges to get cut off on smaller screens, say &quot;use fixed map&quot;.
<p>
 Section 7 - Multiple Maps
<p>
 You can have multiple maps, for example for different floors in a building or if your game has different discontinuous areas. To use a figure other than the Figure of Map for a room, say something like:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The map figure of the Attic is Figure of Attic.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Section 8 - Legend
<p>
 You can have a fixed image like a legend/key that doesn't move with the rest of the map. To do this, say something like:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The right map overlay is the Figure of Compass.</font></blockquote>
<p>
