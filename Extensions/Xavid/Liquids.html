<p>
 This extension provides basic support for sources of liquids and things that can hold a liquid. It has some similarities to Liquid Handling by Al Golden but restricts itself to pretty basic functionality, not addressing possibilities like mixing liquids and interactions between liquids and other objects. It also isn't interested in measuring volumes of liquid.
<p>
 Chapter 1 - Vessels and Water-Tight Things
<p>
 A thing can be water-tight, which means it can hold a liquid. A vessel is a kind of thing that is water-tight, but you can also declare things water-tight directly, for example if you want a water-tight container (that can hold both liquids and things).
<p>
 A water-tight thing has a property called the contained liquid. Thus, you can create a vessel full of water with:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> A vessel called a bottle is here. The contained liquid is water.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Liquids are a kind of enumerated value, rather than a thing. (The water in two different things is equivalent, rather than them being two separate objects.) You can't interact with the liquid directly, but with whatever it's in. (However, you can use the contained liquid to refer to the thing it's in.)
<p>
 If there's nothing currently in a water-tight thing, its contained liquid is the special &quot;liquid&quot; emptiness. Aside from emptiness, the only default liquid is water, but you can easily create new liquids with something like:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> There is a liquid called milk.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Water-tight things are considered empty or nonempty based on whether they contain a liquid. You can also refer to them with phrases like &quot;if the noun is full of water&quot; or &quot;if water fills the noun&quot;.
<p>
 Chapter 2 - Liquid-Yielding Things
<p>
 Sometimes you want to have something be an infinite source of a liquid. To do this, just set the available liquid property of it.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> A thing called the fountain is here. The available liquid is water.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 You can fill containers at these liquid-yielding things freely.
<p>
 Such things are considered liquid-yielding, and you can refer to them with phrases like &quot;if the noun yields water&quot; or &quot;if water is available at the noun&quot;.
<p>
 Chapter 3 - Actions
<p>
 This extension defines only a few basic actions to do with liquids, with the expectation that individual games will probably want to add more depending on how they want liquids to be used.
<p>
 You can fill a water-tight thing from a liquid-yielding thing or from another water-tight thing. (In the latter case, the source thing will now be empty, because it's assumed that all water-tight things have equivalent capacities.)
<p>
 You can pour out a water-tight thing, in which case the contained liquid is lost.
<p>
 You can pour a water-tight thing onto something specific. By default, this is blocked by the block pouring onto rule.
<p>
 You can also drink from a water-tight thing. The default behavior assumes that liquids are safe to drink and have no side-effects.
<p>
