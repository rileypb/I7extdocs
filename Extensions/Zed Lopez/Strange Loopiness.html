<p>
 This is experimental and mostly made out of the undocumented features in the Standard Rules the docs call on us not to use.
<p>
 Adds while and until loops. Among other things, this makes it easy to loop indefinitely until a condition is met, which comes in handy sometimes. On the other hand, this makes it easy to loop indefinitely.
<p>
 Inform 7's existing repeat statements make it hard to infinitely loop, which I'm guessing was a deliberate design decision. So be warned that these loops are powerful tools whose power is by default pointed at your foot: make sure your loop incrementally approaches its exit condition.
<p>
 If you Include If True by Zed Lopez, then while and until will be able to take plain truth states instead of full conditionals.
<p>
 Infinitely loop (your obligation to break out):
<p>
 ``` repeat while true: ```
<p>
 Repeat down across a range:
<p>
 ``` repeat with x running from 12 down to 2: ```
<p>
 ``` repeat with hue running from indigo down to orange: ```
<p>
 For all of the loops, you can also provide a loop index variable. Don't alter the loop index variable manually or it'll cease being a useful loop index variable.
<p>
 Enumerated values in a specified range:
<p>
 ``` repeat with the-color running from red to blue with index i: ```
<p>
 Descriptions of objects:
<p>
 ``` repeat with closed-thing running through closed things with index i: ```
<p>
 Lists:
<p>
 ``` repeat with item running through L with index i: ```
<p>
 To save you the trouble of reversing a list you want to iterate through, you can specify backwards.
<p>
 ``` repeat for item in L backwards: ```
<p>
 or
<p>
 ``` repeat for item in L in reverse: ```
<p>
 Tables with row number:
<p>
 ``` repeat through Table of Regrets with row number row-id; ```
<p>
 But when you're going through a table backwards or sorting by a column, the row number will typically be different from a count of iterations through the loop, so if you really want the latter, too:
<p>
 ``` repeat through Table of Regrets with row number row-id and index i; ```
<p>
 (There isn't a provided option for just the index without the row number.)
<p>
 The compiler does magic I can't reproduce to let the same phrase preamble work for descriptions of objects and descriptions of enumerated values. So the loop over a description of values with index case only works for objects. If you're working with enumerated values and you want the index, do your choice of the following:
<p>
 ``` repeat with the-color running through colors: let index be the-color cast as a number; ```
<p>
 or:
<p>
 ``` repeat for the-color from the first value in colors to the last value in colors with index: ```
<p>
 or: ``` repeat for the-color from red to yellow with index i begin;
<p>
 Definition: a color (called C) is infragreen if C &lt; green.
<p>
 let i be 0; repeat for c in infragreen colors begin; increment i; ```
<p>
 Reserve this form for descriptions of objects:
<p>
 ``` repeat with drafty running through open containers with index i: ```
<p>
 Be warned that if you do try using it with enumerated values, there *won't* be an error: the body of the loop won't be executed; it will just return immediately.
<p>
 Also modifies existing syntax:
<p>
 &quot;repeat running through&quot; and &quot;repeat through&quot; are interchangeable (i.e., &quot;running&quot; is permissible while looping through tables, and omitting it is permissible everywhere)
<p>
 &quot;for&quot; may replace &quot;with&quot;
<p>
 &quot;in&quot; may replace &quot;from&quot;
<p>
 &quot;in&quot; may replace &quot;through&quot;
<p>
 So all of the following are equivalent:
<p>
 Repeat with i running from 1 to 10 Repeat with i from 1 to 10 Repeat for i in 1 to 10
<p>
 And these are equivalent:
<p>
 Repeat running through the Table of Regrets: Repeat through the Table of Regrets: Repeat in the Table of Regrets:
<p>
 other examples:
<p>
 repeat through the table of regrets backwards by decision-badness using row number row-id

 Section Changelog
<p>
 1/211027 Added repeat n times loop. Improved documentation. Added looping through lists backwards.
<p>
 1/210930 Add separate case for repeat through list of text with index case, which had been failing. Any list of a block-valued kind other than text will still fail.
<p>
 1/210928 Use I6-native do-until loop; prior implementation could break with multiple until loops
